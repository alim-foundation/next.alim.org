        "Body":  "According to most of the authorities, this invocation\n\t\t\t\t(which occurs at the beginning of every surah with the\n\t\t\t\texception of surah 9) constitutes an integral part of\n\t\t\t\t\"The Opening\" and is, therefore, numbered as verse {1}.\n\t\t\t\tIn all other instances, the invocation \"in the name of\n\t\t\t\tGod\" precedes the surah as such, and is not counted among\n\t\t\t\tits verses. - Both the divine epithets rahman and rahim\n\t\t\t\tare derived from the noun rahmah, which signifies\n\t\t\t\t\"mercy\", \"compassion\", \"loving tenderness\" and, more\n\t\t\t\tcomprehensively, \"grace\". From the very earliest times,\n\t\t\t\tIslamic scholars have endeavoured to define the exact\n\t\t\t\tshades of meaning which differentiate the two terms. The\n\t\t\t\tbest and simplest of these explanations is undoubtedly\n\t\t\t\tthe one advanced by Ibn al-Qayyim (as quoted in Manar\n\t\t\t\tI,48): the term rahman circumscribes the quality of\n\t\t\t\tabounding grace inherent in, and inseparable from, the\n\t\t\t\tconcept of God\u0027s Being, whereas rahim expresses the\n\t\t\t\tmanifestation of that grace in, and its effect upon, His\n\t\t\t\tcreation - in other words, an aspect of His activity."

        "Body":  "Out of the many meanings attributable to the term nafs -\n\t\t\t\tsoul, spirit, mind, animate being, living entity, human\n\t\t\t\tbeing, person, self (in the sense of a personal\n\t\t\t\tidentity), humankind, lifeessence, vital principle, and\n\t\t\t\tso forth - most of the classical commentators choose\n\t\t\t\t\"human being\", and assume that it refers here to Adam.\n\t\t\t\tMuhammad \u0027Abduh, however, rejects this interpretation\n\t\t\t\t(Manar IV, 323 ff.) and gives, instead, his preference to\n\t\t\t\t\"humankind\" inasmuch as this term stresses the common\n\t\t\t\torigin and brotherhood of the human race (which,\n\t\t\t\tundoubtedly, is the purport of the above verse), without,\n\t\t\t\tat the same time, unwarrantably tying it to the Biblical\n\t\t\t\taccount of the creation of Adam and Eve. My rendering of\n\t\t\t\tnafs, in this context, as \"living entity\" follows the\n\t\t\t\tsame reasoning. - As regards the expression zawjaha (\"its\n\t\t\t\tmate\"), it is to be noted that, with reference to animate\n\t\t\t\tbeings, the term zawj (\"a pair\", \"one of a pair\" or \"a\n\t\t\t\tmate\") applies to the male as well as to the female\n\t\t\t\tcomponent of a pair or couple; hence, with reference to\n\t\t\t\thuman beings, it signifies a woman\u0027s mate (husband) as\n\t\t\t\twell as a man\u0027s mate (wife). Abu Muslim - as quoted by\n\t\t\t\tRazi - interprets the phrase \"He created out of it\n\t\t\t\t(minha) its mate\" as meaning \"He created its mate [i.e.,\n\t\t\t\tits sexual counterpart] out of its own kind (min\n\t\t\t\tjinsiha)\", thus supporting the view of Muhammad \u0027Abduh\n\t\t\t\treferred to above. The literal translation of minha as\n\t\t\t\t\"out of it\" clearly alludes, in conformity with the text,\n\t\t\t\tto the biological fact that both sexes have originated\n\t\t\t\tfrom \"one living entity\"."

In its plural form anfal, which occurs in the\n\t\t\t\tQur\u0027an only in the above verse, this word signifies\n\t\t\t\t\"spoils of war\", inasmuch as such spoils are an\n\t\t\t\tincidental accession above and beyond anything that a\n\t\t\t\tmujahid (\"a fighter in God\u0027s cause\") is entitled to\n\t\t\t\texpect.

(It is to be borne in\n\t\t\t\tmind that in classical Arabic a diminutive is often\n\t\t\t\texpressive of no more than endearment: e.g., ya bunayya,\n\t\t\t\twhich does not necessarily signify \"O my little son\" but,\n\t\t\t\trather, \"my dear son\" irrespective of the son\u0027s age.) On\n\t\t\t\tthe whole, we may safely assume that the words ya sin\n\t\t\t\tapostrophize the Prophet Muhammad, who is explicitly\n\t\t\t\taddressed in the sequence, and are meant to stress - as\n\t\t\t\tthe Qur\u0027an so often does - the fact of his and all other\n\t\t\t\tapostles\u0027 humanness."

As described in a number of\n\t\t\t\treports going back to some Companions, the moon appeared\n\t\t\t\tone night as if split into two distinct parts. While\n\t\t\t\tthere is no reason to doubt the subjective veracity of\n\t\t\t\tthese reports, it is possible that what actually happened\n\t\t\t\twas an unusual kind of partial lunar eclipse, which\n\t\t\t\tproduced an equally unusual optical illusion. But\n\t\t\t\twhatever the nature of that phenomenon, it is practically\n\t\t\t\tcertain that the above Qur\u0027an-verse does not refer to it\n\t\t\t\tbut, rather, to a future event: namely, to what will\n\t\t\t\thappen when the Last Hour approaches. (The Qur\u0027an\n\t\t\t\tfrequently employs the past tense to denote the future,\n\t\t\t\tand particularly so in passages which speak of the coming\n\t\t\t\tof the Last Hour and of Resurrection Day; this use of the\n\t\t\t\tpast tense is meant to stress the certainty of the\n\t\t\t\thappening to which the verb relates.) Thus, Raghib\n\t\t\t\tregards it as fully justifiable to interpret the phrase\n\t\t\t\tinshaqqa \u0027l-qamar (\"the moon is split asunder\") as\n\t\t\t\tbearing on the cosmic cataclysm - the end of the world as\n\t\t\t\twe know it - that will occur before the coming of\n\t\t\t\tResurrection Day (see art. shaqq in the  Mufradat). As\n\t\t\t\tmentioned by Zamakhshari, this interpretation has the\n\t\t\t\tsupport of some of the earlier commentators; and it is,\n\t\t\t\tto my mind, particularly convincing in view of the\n\t\t\t\tjuxtaposition, in the above Qur\u0027an-verse, of the moon\u0027s\n\t\t\t\t\"splitting asunder\" and the approach of the Last Hour.\n\t\t\t\t(In this connection we must bear in mind the fact that\n\t\t\t\tnone of the Qur\u0027anic allusions to the \"nearness\" of the\n\t\t\t\tLast Hour and the Day of Resurrection is based on the\n\t\t\t\thuman concept of \"time\".)"

Almost equally unconvincing - because somewhat\n\t\t\t\tlaboured - are the explanations which link those five\n\t\t\t\tparticiples to the souls of the dying, or to warriors\n\t\t\t\tengaged in holy war, or to war-mounts, and so forth. The\n\t\t\t\tclearest and simplest interpretation is that advanced by\n\t\t\t\tQatadah (as quoted by Tabari and Baghawi) and Al-Hasan\n\t\t\t\tal-Basri (quoted by Baghawi and Razi), who maintain that\n\t\t\t\twhat is meant in this passage are the stars - including\n\t\t\t\tthe sun and the moon - and their movements in space: and\n\t\t\t\tthis interpretation is fully in tune with many other\n\t\t\t\tpassages in the Qur\u0027an in which the harmony of those\n\t\t\t\tcelestial bodies in their multiform orbits and graded\n\t\t\t\tspeeds is cited as an evidence of God\u0027s planning and\n\t\t\t\tcreativeness. In accordance with this interpretation, the\n\t\t\t\tparticiple an-nazi\u0027at occurring in the first verse\n\t\t\t\tdenotes the daily \"ascending\" or \"rising\" of the stars,\n\t\t\t\twhile their subsequent \"setting\" is indicated by the\n\t\t\t\texpression gharqan, which comprises the two concepts of\n\t\t\t\t\"drowning,\" (i.e., disappearing) and, tropically, of the\n\t\t\t\t\"completeness\" of this daily phenomenon (Zamakhshari)."

Now if we analyze\n\t\t\t\tthe origin of this noun, we find that it is derived from\n\t\t\t\tthe verb taraqa, which primarily means \"he beat\n\t\t\t\t[something]\" or \"knocked [at something]\"; hence, taraqa\n\t\t\t\t\u0027l-bab, \"he knocked at the door\". Tropically, the noun\n\t\t\t\tsignifies \"anything [or \"anyone\"] that comes in the\n\t\t\t\tnight\", because a person who comes to a house by night is\n\t\t\t\texpected to knock at the door (Taj al-\u0027Arus). In the\n\t\t\t\tQur\u0027anic mode of expression, at-tariq is evidently a\n\t\t\t\tmetaphor for the heavenly solace which sometimes comes to\n\t\t\t\ta human being lost in the deepest darkness of affliction\n\t\t\t\tand distress; or for the sudden, intuitive enlightenment\n\t\t\t\twhich disperses the darkness of uncertainty; or, finally,\n\t\t\t\tfor divine revelation, which knocks, as it were, at the\n\t\t\t\tdoors of man\u0027s heart, and thus fulfils the functions of\n\t\t\t\tboth solace and enlightenment. (For my rendering of the\n\t\t\t\tadjurative wa as \"Consider\", see surah {74}, first half\n\t\t\t\tof note [23].)"

The defeats and victories\n\t\t\t\tspoken of above relate to the last phases of the\n\t\t\t\tcenturies-long struggle between the Byzantine and Persian\n\t\t\t\tEmpires. During the early years of the seventh century\n\t\t\t\tthe Persians conquered parts of Syria and Anatolia, \"the\n\t\t\t\tlands close-by\", i.e., near the heartland of the\n\t\t\t\tByzantine Empire; in 613 they took Damascus, and in 614,\n\t\t\t\tJerusalem; Egypt fell to them in 615-16, and at the same\n\t\t\t\ttime they laid siege to Constantinople itself. At the\n\t\t\t\ttime of the revelation of this surah - about the seventh\n\t\t\t\tyear before the hijrah, corresponding to 615 or 616 of\n\t\t\t\tthe Christian era - the total destruction of the\n\t\t\t\tByzantine Empire seemed imminent. The few Muslims around\n\t\t\t\tthe Prophet were despondent on hearing the news of the\n\t\t\t\tutter discomfiture of the Byzantines, who were Christians\n\t\t\t\tand, as such, believed in the One God. The pagan Quraysh,\n\t\t\t\ton the other hand, sympathized with Persians who, they\n\t\t\t\tthought, would vindicate their own opposition to the\n\t\t\t\tOne-God idea. When Muhammad enunciated the above\n\t\t\t\tQur\u0027an-verses predicting a Byzantine victory \"within a\n\t\t\t\tfew years\", this prophecy was received with derision by\n\t\t\t\tthe Quraysh. Now the term bid\u0027 (commonly rendered as \"a\n\t\t\t\tfew\") denotes any number between three and ten; and, as\n\t\t\t\tit happened, in 622 - i.e., six or seven years after the\n\t\t\t\tQur\u0027anic prediction - the tide turned in favour of the\n\t\t\t\tByzantines. In that year, Emperor Heraclius succeeded in\n\t\t\t\tdefeating the Persians at Issus, south of the Taurus\n\t\t\t\tMountains, and subsequently drove them out of Asia Minor.\n\t\t\t\tBy 624, he carried the war into Persian territory and\n\t\t\t\tthus put the enemy on the defensive; and in the beginning\n\t\t\t\tof December, 626, the Persian armies were completely\n\t\t\t\trouted by the Byzantines."

This assumption is,\n\t\t\t\thowever, deficient on two counts: firstly, it is\n\t\t\t\twell-known that not all of the erring ones from among the\n\t\t\t\tahl al-kitab and the mushrikin accepted the message of\n\t\t\t\tthe Qur\u0027an when it was conveyed to them; and, secondly,\n\t\t\t\tthe ahl al-kitab are spoken of in verse {4} as having\n\t\t\t\t\"broken their unity [of faith]\" - i.e., offended against\n\t\t\t\tthe fundamental principles of that faith - after \"the\n\t\t\t\tevidence of the truth\" had come to them. This apparent\n\t\t\t\tcontradiction has been convincingly resolved by no less\n\t\t\t\tan authority than Ibn Taymiyyah (see Tafsir Sitt Suwar,\n\t\t\t\tpp. 391 ff.); and it is his interpretation that I have\n\t\t\t\tfollowed in my rendering of the above three verses.\n\t\t\t\tAccording to Ibn Taymiyyah, the pivotal phrase lam yakun\n\t\t\t\tmunfakkin does not denote \"they did not give up\" or\n\t\t\t\t\"separate themselves from\", but, rather, \"they are not\n\t\t\t\tabandoned\" - i.e., condemned by God - unless and until\n\t\t\t\tthey have been shown the right way by a God-sent prophet,\n\t\t\t\tand thereupon have consciously refused to follow it: and\n\t\t\t\tthis is in accord with repeated statements in the Qur\u0027an\n\t\t\t\tto the effect that God does not take anyone to task for\n\t\t\t\twrong beliefs and wrong actions unless the true meaning\n\t\t\t\tof right and wrong has previously been made clear to him\n\t\t\t\t(cf. {6:131-132} and the second paragraph of \u003ca href=\u0027qa:17.15\u0027\u003e17:15\u003c/a\u003e, as\n\t\t\t\twell as the corresponding notes). Hence, the above\n\t\t\t\treference to \"the evidence of the truth\" does not relate\n\t\t\t\tonly to the Qur\u0027an and the Prophet Muhammad but to all\n\t\t\t\tthe earlier prophets and revelations as well (cf. \u003ca href=\u0027qa:42.13\u0027\u003e42:13\u003c/a\u003e\n\t\t\t\tand the corresponding notes [12-14]- just as the\n\t\t\t\t\"ordinances of ever-true soundness and clarity\" (spelled\n\t\t\t\tout in verse {5} below) are common to all God-inspired\n\t\t\t\tmessages, of which the Qur\u0027an is the final, most perfect\n\t\t\t\texpression."

The metaphoric image\n\t\t\t\tdeveloped in the above five verses is closely connected\n\t\t\t\twith the sequence, although this connection has never\n\t\t\t\tbeen brought out by the classical commentators. The term\n\t\t\t\tal-\u0027adiyat undoubtedly denotes the war-horses, or\n\t\t\t\tchargers, employed by the Arabs from time immemorial down\n\t\t\t\tto the Middle Ages (the feminine gender of this term\n\t\t\t\tbeing due to the fact that, as a rule, they preferred\n\t\t\t\tmares to stallions). But whereas the conventional\n\t\t\t\texplanation is based on the assumption that \"the\n\t\t\t\tchargers\" symbolize here the believers\u0027 fight in God\u0027s\n\t\t\t\tcause (jihad) and, therefore, represent something highly\n\t\t\t\tcommendable, it takes no account whatever of the\n\t\t\t\tdiscrepancy between so positive an imagery and the\n\t\t\t\tcondemnation expressed in verses {6} ff., not to speak of\n\t\t\t\tthe fact that such a conventional interpretation does not\n\t\t\t\tprovide any logical link between the two parts of the\n\t\t\t\tsurah. But since such a link must exist, and since verses\n\t\t\t\t{6-11} are undoubtedly condemnatory, we must conclude\n\t\t\t\tthat the first five verses, too, have the same - or, at\n\t\t\t\tleast, a similar - character.

As already mentioned in the\n\t\t\t\tintroductory note, the particular chastisement to which\n\t\t\t\tthe above verse alludes seems to have been a sudden\n\t\t\t\tepidemic of extreme virulence: according to Waqidi and\n\t\t\t\tMuhammad ibn Ishaq - the latter as quoted by Ibn Hisham\n\t\t\t\tand Ibn Kathir - \"this was the first time that spotted\n\t\t\t\tfever (hasbah) and smallpox (judari) appeared in the land\n\t\t\t\tof the Arabs\". It is interesting to note that the word\n\t\t\t\thasbah - which, according to some authorities, signifies\n\t\t\t\talso typhus - primarily means \"pelting [or smiting\"] with\n\t\t\t\tstones\" (Qamus). - As regards the noun ta\u0027ir (of which\n\t\t\t\ttayr is the plural), we ought to remember that it denotes\n\t\t\t\tany \"flying creature\", whether bird or insect (Taj\n\t\t\t\tal-\u0027Arus). Neither the Qur\u0027an nor any authentic Tradition\n\t\t\t\toffers us any evidence as to the nature of the \"flying\n\t\t\t\tcreatures\" mentioned in the above verse; and since, on\n\t\t\t\tthe other hand, all the \"descriptions\" indulged in by the\n\t\t\t\tcommentators are purely imaginary, they need not be\n\t\t\t\tseriously considered. If the hypothesis of an epidemic is\n\t\t\t\tcorrect, the \"flying creatures\" - whether birds or\n\t\t\t\tinsects - may well have been the carriers of the\n\t\t\t\tinfection. One thing, however, is clear: whatever the\n\t\t\t\tnature of the doom that overtook the invading force, it\n\t\t\t\twas certainly miraculous in the true sense of this word -\n\t\t\t\tnamely, in the sudden, totally unexpected rescue which it\n\t\t\t\tbrought to the distressed people of Mecca."

Since, however, the pronoun \"it\" relates here to the\n\t\t\t\tQur\u0027an, the metaphorical expression \"between its hands\"\n\t\t\t\tor \"before it\" cannot possibly refer to \"knowledge\" (as\n\t\t\t\tit does in \u003ca href=\u0027qa:2.255\u0027\u003e2:255\u003c/a\u003e), but must obviously refer to an\n\t\t\t\tobjective reality with which the Qur\u0027an is \"confronted\":\n\t\t\t\tthat is, something that was coexistent in time with the\n\t\t\t\trevelation of the Qur\u0027an. Now this, taken together (a)\n\t\t\t\twith the fact - frequently stressed in the Qur\u0027an and\n\t\t\t\tsince established by objective scholarship - that in the\n\t\t\t\tcourse of the millennia the Bible has been subjected to\n\t\t\t\tconsiderable and often arbitrary alteration, and (b) with\n\t\t\t\tthe fact that many of the laws enunciated in the Qur\u0027an\n\t\t\t\tdiffer from the laws of the Bible, brings us forcibly to\n\t\t\t\tthe conclusion that the \"confirmation\" of the latter by\n\t\t\t\tthe Qur\u0027an can refer only to the basic truths still\n\t\t\t\tdiscernible in the Bible, and not to its time-bound\n\t\t\t\tlegislation or to its present text - in other words, a\n\t\t\t\tconfirmation of whatever was extant of its basic\n\t\t\t\tteachings at the time of the revelation of the Qur\u0027an:\n\t\t\t\tand it is this that the phrase ma bayna yadayhi expresses\n\t\t\t\tin this context as well as in \u003ca href=\u0027qa:5.46\u0027\u003e5:46\u003c/a\u003e and {48} or in\n\t\t\t\t\u003ca href=\u0027qa:61.6\u0027\u003e61:6\u003c/a\u003e (where it refers to Jesus\u0027 confirming the truth of\n\t\t\t\t\"whatever there still remained [i.e., in his lifetime] of\n\t\t\t\tthe Torah\")."

Most of\n\t\t\t\tthem assume that it refers to the pilgrimage in the year\n\t\t\t\t9 H., in which the Prophet himself did not participate,\n\t\t\t\thaving entrusted Abu Bakr with the office of amir\n\t\t\t\tal-hajj. This very fact, however, makes it improbable\n\t\t\t\tthat the designation \"the Greatest Pilgrimage\" should\n\t\t\t\thave been given in the Qur\u0027an to this particular\n\t\t\t\tpilgrimage. On the other hand, there exists a Tradition\n\t\t\t\ton the authority of \u0027Abd Allah ibn \u0027Umar to the effect\n\t\t\t\tthat the Prophet described in these very words the last\n\t\t\t\tpilgrimage led by himself in 10 H. and known to history\n\t\t\t\tas the Farewell Pilgrimage (Zamakhshari, Razi); one may,\n\t\t\t\ttherefore, assume that it is this which is alluded to\n\t\t\t\there. If this assumption is correct, it would justify the\n\t\t\t\tconclusion that verses {3} and {4} of this surah were\n\t\t\t\trevealed during the Farewell Pilgrimage, i.e., shortly\n\t\t\t\tbefore the Prophet\u0027s death. This might explain the -\n\t\t\t\totherwise perplexing - statement, reliably attributed to\n\t\t\t\tthe Prophet\u0027s Companion Al-Bara\u0027 (Bukhari, Kitab\n\t\t\t\tat-Tafsir), that At-Tawbah was the last surah revealed to\n\t\t\t\tthe Prophet: for, although it is established beyond any\n\t\t\t\tdoubt that the surah as a whole was revealed in 9 H. and\n\t\t\t\twas followed by several other parts of the Qur\u0027an, e.g.,\n\t\t\t\tAl-Ma\u0027idah, it is possible that what Al-Bara\u0027 had in mind\n\t\t\t\twere only these two key-verses ({3} and {4}) of\n\t\t\t\tAt-Tawbah, which conceivably were revealed during the\n\t\t\t\tFarewell Pilgrimage."

Most of the commentators assume\n\t\t\t\tunquestioningly that this relates to female slaves, and\n\t\t\t\tthat the particle aw (\"or\") denotes a permissible\n\t\t\t\talternative. This conventional interpretation is, in my\n\t\t\t\topinion inadmissible inasmuch as it is based on the\n\t\t\t\tassumption that sexual intercourse with one\u0027s female\n\t\t\t\tslave is permitted without marriage: an assumption which\n\t\t\t\tis contradicted by the Qur\u0027an itself (see \u003ca href=\u0027qa:4.3\u0027\u003e4:3\u003c/a\u003e, {24},\n\t\t\t\t{25} and \u003ca href=\u0027qa:24.32\u0027\u003e24:32\u003c/a\u003e, with the corresponding notes). Nor is\n\t\t\t\tthis the only objection to the above-mentioned\n\t\t\t\tinterpretation. Since the Qur\u0027an applies the term\n\t\t\t\t\"believers\" to men and women alike, and since the term\n\t\t\t\tazwaj (\"spouses\"), too, denotes both the male and the\n\t\t\t\tfemale partners in marriage, there is no reason for\n\t\t\t\tattributing to the phrase aw ma malakat aymanuhum the\n\t\t\t\tmeaning of \"their female slaves\"; and since, on the other\n\t\t\t\thand, it is out of the question that female and male\n\t\t\t\tslaves could have been referred to here, it is obvious\n\t\t\t\tthat this phrase does not relate to slaves at all, but\n\t\t\t\thas the same meaning as in \u003ca href=\u0027qa:4.24\u0027\u003e4:24\u003c/a\u003e- namely, \"those whom\n\t\t\t\tthey rightfully possess through wedlock\" (see note [26]\n\t\t\t\ton \u003ca href=\u0027qa:4.24\u0027\u003e4:24\u003c/a\u003e) - with the significant difference that in the\n\t\t\t\tpresent context this expression relates to both husbands\n\t\t\t\tand wives, who \"rightfully possess\" one another by virtue\n\t\t\t\tof marriage. On the basis of this interpretation, the\n\t\t\t\tparticle aw which precedes this clause does not denote an\n\t\t\t\talternative (\"or\") but is, rather, in the nature of an\n\t\t\t\texplanatory amplification, more or less analgous to the\n\t\t\t\tphrase \"in other words\" or \"that is\", thus giving to the\n\t\t\t\twhole sentence the meaning, \"...save with their spouses -\n\t\t\t\tthat is, those whom they rightfully possess [through\n\t\t\t\twedlock]...\", etc. (Cf. a similar construction 25:62 -\n\t\t\t\t\"for him who has the will to take thought - that is\n\t\t\t\t[lit., \"or\"], has the will to be grateful\".)"

The reason why the believer is enjoined to\n\t\t\t\t\"seek refuge with God\" from such practices despite their\n\t\t\t\tpalpable irrationality is - according to Zamakhshari - to\n\t\t\t\tbe found in the inherent sinfulness of such endeavours\n\t\t\t\t(see surah {2}, note [84]), and in the mental danger in\n\t\t\t\twhich they may involve their author."

It is obvious that the phrase \"two, or\n\t\t\t\tthree, or four: but if you have reason to fear...\", etc.\n\t\t\t\tis a parenthetic clause relating to both the free women\n\t\t\t\tmentioned in the first part of the sentence and to female\n\t\t\t\tslaves - for both these nouns are governed by the\n\t\t\t\timperative verb \"marry\". Thus, the whole sentence has\n\t\t\t\tthis meaning: \"Marry from among [other] women such as are\n\t\t\t\tlawful to you, or [from among] those whom you rightfully\n\t\t\t\tpossess - [even] two, or three, or four: but if you have\n\t\t\t\treason to fear that you might not be able to treat them\n\t\t\t\twith equal fairness, then [only] one\" - implying that,\n\t\t\t\tirrespective of whether they are free women or,\n\t\t\t\toriginally, slaves, the number of wives must not exceed\n\t\t\t\tfour. It was in this sense that Muhammad \u0027Abduh\n\t\t\t\tunderstood the above verse (see Manar IV, 350). This view\n\t\t\t\tis, moreover, supported by verse {25} of this surah as\n\t\t\t\twell as by \u003ca href=\u0027qa:24.32\u0027\u003e24:32\u003c/a\u003e, where marriage with female slaves is\n\t\t\t\tspoken of. Contrary to the popular view and the practice\n\t\t\t\tof many Muslims in the past centuries, neither the Qur\u0027an\n\t\t\t\tnor the life-example of the Prophet provides any sanction\n\t\t\t\tfor sexual intercourse without marriage. As regards the\n\t\t\t\tpermission to marry more than one wife (up to the maximum\n\t\t\t\tof four), it is so restricted by the condition, \"if you\n\t\t\t\thave reason to fear that you might not be able to treat\n\t\t\t\tthem with equal fairness, then [marry only] one\", as to\n\t\t\t\tmake such plural marriages possible only in quite\n\t\t\t\texceptional cases and under exceptional circumstances\n\t\t\t\t(see also the first clause of \u003ca href=\u0027qa:24.32\u0027\u003e24:32\u003c/a\u003e and the\n\t\t\t\tcorresponding note [42]). Still, one might ask why the\n\t\t\t\tsame latitude has not been given to women as well; but\n\t\t\t\tthe answer is simple. Notwithstanding the spiritual\n\t\t\t\tfactor of love which influences the relations between man\n\t\t\t\tand woman, the determinant biological reason for the\n\t\t\t\tsexual urge is, in both sexes, procreation: and whereas a\n\t\t\t\twoman can, at one time, conceive a child from one man\n\t\t\t\tonly and has to carry it for nine months before she can\n\t\t\t\tconceive another, a man can beget a child every time he\n\t\t\t\tcohabits with a woman. Thus, while nature would have been\n\t\t\t\tmerely wasteful if it had produced a polygamous instinct\n\t\t\t\tin woman, man\u0027s polygamous inclination is biologically\n\t\t\t\tjustified. It is, of course, obvious that the biological\n\t\t\t\tfactor is only one - and by no means always the most\n\t\t\t\timportant - of the aspects of marital love: none the\n\t\t\t\tless, it is a basic factor and, therefore, decisive in\n\t\t\t\tthe institution of marriage as such. With the wisdom that\n\t\t\t\talways takes human nature fully into account, Islamic Law\n\t\t\t\tundertakes no more than the safeguarding of the\n\t\t\t\tsocio-biological function of marriage (which includes\n\t\t\t\talso care of the progeny), allowing a man to have more\n\t\t\t\tthan one wife and not allowing a woman to have more than\n\t\t\t\tone husband at one time; while the spiritual problem of\n\t\t\t\tmarriage, being imponderable and therefore outside the\n\t\t\t\tscope of law, is left to the discretion of the partners.\n\t\t\t\tIn any event - since marriage in Islam is a purely civil\n\t\t\t\tcontract - recourse to divorce is always open to either\n\t\t\t\tof the two partners. (Regarding the dissolution of a\n\t\t\t\tmarriage at the wife\u0027s instance, see surah {2}, note\n\t\t\t\t[218].)"

Thus, He does not forsake anyone\n\t\t\t\texcept those who deserve to be forsaken, and does not\n\t\t\t\tbestow His favour upon anyone except those who deserve to\n\t\t\t\tbe favoured.\" Commenting on the identical phrase\n\t\t\t\toccurring in \u003ca href=\u0027qa:16.93\u0027\u003e16:93\u003c/a\u003e, Zamakhshari states: \"[God] forsakes\n\t\t\t\thim who, as He knows, will [consciously] choose to deny\n\t\t\t\tthe truth and will persevere in this [denial]; and...He\n\t\t\t\tbestows His favour upon him who, as He knows, will choose\n\t\t\t\tfaith: which means that He makes the issue dependent on\n\t\t\t\t[man\u0027s] free choice (al-ikhtiyar), and thus on his\n\t\t\t\tdeserving either [God\u0027s] favour or the withdrawal of\n\t\t\t\t[His] aid...and does not make it dependent on compulsion\n\t\t\t\t[i.e., predestination], which would rule out [man\u0027s]\n\t\t\t\tdeserving anything of the above.\""

In his commentary on the verse which we are\n\t\t\t\tnow considering, Baydawi states explicitly that the\n\t\t\t\t\"bearing\" of God\u0027s throne of almightiness (al-\u0027arsh - see\n\t\t\t\tnote [43] on \u003ca href=\u0027qa:7.54\u0027\u003e7:54\u003c/a\u003e) must be understood in a metaphorical\n\t\t\t\tsense: \"Their carrying it and surrounding it [or \"being\n\t\t\t\tnear it\"] is a metaphor of their being mindful of it and\n\t\t\t\tacting in accordance therewith (majaz \u0027an hifzihim\n\t\t\t\twa-tadbirihim lahu), or a metonym (kinayah) for their\n\t\t\t\tcloseness to the Lord of the Throne, their dignity in His\n\t\t\t\tsight, and their being instrumental in the realization of\n\t\t\t\tHis will.\" My rendering of the above verse reflects\n\t\t\t\tBaydawi\u0027s interpretation. - As regards the beings which\n\t\t\t\tare said to be close to the throne of God\u0027s almightiness,\n\t\t\t\tmost of the classical commentators obviously basing their\n\t\t\t\tview on the symbolic image of \"the angels surrounding the\n\t\t\t\tthrone of [God\u0027s] almightiness\" on the Day of Judgment\n\t\t\t\t(\u003ca href=\u0027qa:39.75\u0027\u003e39:75\u003c/a\u003e) - think in this instance, too, exclusively of\n\t\t\t\tangels. But whereas it cannot be denied that the present\n\t\t\t\tverse refers also to angels, it does not follow that it\n\t\t\t\trefers exclusively to them. In its abstract connotation,\n\t\t\t\tthe verb hamala frequently signifies \"he bore [or \"took\n\t\t\t\tupon himself\"] the responsibility [for something]\": and\n\t\t\t\tso it is evident that it applies here not only to angels\n\t\t\t\tbut also to all human beings who are conscious of the\n\t\t\t\ttremendous implications of the concept of God\u0027s\n\t\t\t\talmightiness, and hence feel morally responsible for\n\t\t\t\ttranslating this consciousness into the reality of their\n\t\t\t\town and their fellow-beings\u0027 lives."

This meaning is easily\n\t\t\t\tgrasped when we bear in mind that the root verb of the\n\t\t\t\tparticipial noun kafir (and of the infinitive noun kufr)\n\t\t\t\tis kafara, \"he [or \"it\"] covered [a thing]\": thus, in\n\t\t\t\t\u003ca href=\u0027qa:57.20\u0027\u003e57:20\u003c/a\u003e the tiller of the soil is called (without any\n\t\t\t\tpejorative implication) kafir, \"one who covers\", i.e.,\n\t\t\t\tthe sown seed with earth, just as the night is spoken of\n\t\t\t\tas having \"covered\" (kafara) the earth with darkness. In\n\t\t\t\ttheir abstract sense, both the verb and the nouns derived\n\t\t\t\tfrom it have a connotation of \"concealing\" something that\n\t\t\t\texists or \"denying\" something that is true. Hence, in the\n\t\t\t\tusage of the Qur\u0027an - with the exception of the one\n\t\t\t\tinstance (in \u003ca href=\u0027qa:57.20\u0027\u003e57:20\u003c/a\u003e) where this participial noun\n\t\t\t\tsignifies a \"tiller of the soil\" - a kafir is \"one who\n\t\t\t\tdenies [or \"refuses to acknowledge\"] the truth\" in the\n\t\t\t\twidest, spiritual sense of this latter term: that is,\n\t\t\t\tirrespective of whether it relates to a cognition of the\n\t\t\t\tsupreme truth - namely, the existence of God - or to a\n\t\t\t\tdoctrine or ordinance enunciated in the divine writ, or\n\t\t\t\tto a self-evident moral proposition, or to an\n\t\t\t\tacknowledgment of, and therefore gratitude for, favours\n\t\t\t\treceived.

Before Islam, one of the foremost opponents\n\t\t\t\tof this custom was Zayd ibn \u0027Amr ibn Nufayl, a cousin of\n\t\t\t\t\u0027Umar ibn al-Khattab and spiritually a precursor of\n\t\t\t\tMuhammad (cf.

The result is a medley of\n\t\t\t\tstories ranging from Abraham\u0027s experiences with his\n\t\t\t\tidolatrous contemporaries (cf. {21:68-70}) to the\n\t\t\t\tBiblical legend of Nebuchadnezzar\u0027s attempt to burn three\n\t\t\t\tpious Israelites in a fiery furnace (The Book of Daniel\n\t\t\t\tiii, 19 ff.), or the persecution, in the sixth century,\n\t\t\t\tof the Christians of Najran by the King of Yemen, Dhu\n\t\t\t\tNawas (who was a Jew by religion), or the entirely\n\t\t\t\tapocryphal story of a Zoroastrian king who burnt to death\n\t\t\t\tthose of his subjects who refused to accept his dictum\n\t\t\t\tthat a marriage of brother and sister was \"permitted by\n\t\t\t\tGod\"; and so forth.

This last\n\t\t\t\tclause has ever since given much trouble to the\n\t\t\t\tcommentators, inasmuch as it is not very plausible that\n\t\t\t\tHe who has revealed the Qur\u0027an to the Prophet should\n\t\t\t\tcause him to forget anything of it. Hence, many\n\t\t\t\tunconvincing explanations have been advanced from very\n\t\t\t\tearly times down to our own days, the least convincing\n\t\t\t\tbeing that last refuge of every perplexed\n\t\t\t\tQuran-commentator, the \"doctrine of abrogation\" (refuted\n\t\t\t\tin my note [87] on \u003ca href=\u0027qa:2.106\u0027\u003e2:106\u003c/a\u003e). However, the supposed\n\t\t\t\tdifficulty of interpretation disappears as soon as we\n\t\t\t\tallow ourselves to realize that the above passage, though\n\t\t\t\tostensibly addressed to the Prophet, is directed at man\n\t\t\t\tin general, and that it is closely related to an earlier\n\t\t\t\tQuranic revelation - namely, the first five verses of\n\t\t\t\tsurah {96} (\"The Germ-Cell\") and, in particular, verses\n\t\t\t\t{3-5}, which speak of God\u0027s having \"taught man what he\n\t\t\t\tdid not know\". In note [3] on those verses I have\n\t\t\t\texpressed the opinion that they allude to mankind\u0027s\n\t\t\t\tcumulative acquisition of empirical and rational\n\t\t\t\tknowledge, handed down from generation to generation and\n\t\t\t\tfrom one civilization to another: and it is to this very\n\t\t\t\tphenomenon that the present passage, too, refers. We are\n\t\t\t\ttold here that God, who has formed man in accordance with\n\t\t\t\twhat he is meant to be and has promised to guide him,\n\t\t\t\twill enable him to acquire (and thus, as it were,\n\t\t\t\t\"impart\" to him) elements of knowledge which mankind will\n\t\t\t\taccumulate, record and collectively \"remember\" - except\n\t\t\t\twhat God may cause man to \"forget\" (in another word, to\n\t\t\t\tabandon) as having become redundant by virtue of his new\n\t\t\t\texperiences and his acquisition of wider, more\n\t\t\t\tdifferentiated elements of knowledge, empirical as well\n\t\t\t\tas deductive or speculative, including more advanced,\n\t\t\t\tempirically acquired skills. However, the very next\n\t\t\t\tsentence makes it clear that all knowledge arrived at\n\t\t\t\tthrough our observation of the external world and through\n\t\t\t\tspeculation, though necessary and most valuable, is\n\t\t\t\tdefinitely limited in scope and does not, therefore, in\n\t\t\t\titself suffice to give us an insight into ultimate\n\t\t\t\ttruths."

Tabari identifies the ayat\n\t\t\t\tmuhkamat (\"messages that are clear in and by themselves\")\n\t\t\t\twith what the philologists and jurists describe as nass -\n\t\t\t\tnamely, ordinances or statements which are self-evident\n\t\t\t\t(zahir) by virtue of their wording (cf. Lisan al-\u0027Arab,\n\t\t\t\tart. nass). Consequently, Tabari regards as ayat muhkamat\n\t\t\t\tonly those statements or ordinances of the Qur\u0027an which\n\t\t\t\tdo not admit of more than one interpretation (which does\n\t\t\t\tnot, of course, preclude differences of opinion regarding\n\t\t\t\tthe implications of a particular ayah muhkamah). In my\n\t\t\t\topinion, however, it would be too dogmatic to regard any\n\t\t\t\tpassage of the Qur\u0027an which does not conform to the above\n\t\t\t\tdefinition as mutashabih (\"allegorical\"): for there are\n\t\t\t\tmany statements in the Qur\u0027an which are liable to more\n\t\t\t\tthan one interpretation but are, nevertheless, not\n\t\t\t\tallegorical - just as there are many expressions and\n\t\t\t\tpassages which, despite their allegorical formulation,\n\t\t\t\treveal to the searching intellect only one possible\n\t\t\t\tmeaning. For this reason, the ayat mutashabihat may be\n\t\t\t\tdefined as those passages of the Qur\u0027an which are\n\t\t\t\texpressed in a figurative manner, with a meaning that is\n\t\t\t\tmetaphorically implied but not directly, in so many\n\t\t\t\twords, stated. The ayat muhkamat are described as the\n\t\t\t\t\"essence of the divine writ\" (umm al-kitab) because they\n\t\t\t\tcomprise the fundamental principles underlying its\n\t\t\t\tmessage and, in particular, its ethical and social\n\t\t\t\tteachings: and it is only on the basis of these clearly\n\t\t\t\tenunciated principles that the allegorical passages can\n\t\t\t\tbe correctly interpreted.

It should be borne in mind that the\n\t\t\t\tverb qassa (the infinitive nouns of which are qasas and\n\t\t\t\tiqtisas) signifies, primarily, \"he followed step by step\"\n\t\t\t\tor \"by degrees\", and, subsequently, \"he related [a piece\n\t\t\t\tof news or a story] as though he followed its traces\":\n\t\t\t\thence, \"he expounded [it] gradually\" or \"he explained\n\t\t\t\t[it]\" (cf. Lane VII, 2526, quoting the Qamus and the Taj\n\t\t\t\tal-\u0027Arus with specific reference to the above verse). If,\n\t\t\t\ton the other hand, the infinitive noun qasas is regarded\n\t\t\t\tas synonymous, in this context, with qis,sah (\"story\" or\n\t\t\t\t\"narrative\"), the above sentence might be rendered as \"We\n\t\t\t\tnarrate unto thee the best of narratives\", i.e., the\n\t\t\t\tsubsequent story of Joseph.

The other\n\t\t\t\t[interpretation] is that man is [prone to become] a\n\t\t\t\tcontender in argument against his Sustainer, refusing to\n\t\t\t\tacknowledge his [very] Creator.\" Razi, on his part, gives\n\t\t\t\this unqualified support to the first of these two\n\t\t\t\tinterpretations, \"because the above verses are meant to\n\t\t\t\tstress the evidence of the existence of a wise Creator,\n\t\t\t\tand not the fact of men\u0027s insolence and their proneness\n\t\t\t\tto blasphemy and ingratitude\". However, in view of\n\t\t\t\t{36:77-78} (revealed at a considerably earlier period), I\n\t\t\t\tam of the opinion that the above two interpretations are\n\t\t\t\tnot mutually exclusive but, rather, complementary,\n\t\t\t\tinasmuch as this passage is meant to bring out man\u0027s\n\t\t\t\tunique quality as a rational being - a quality that may\n\t\t\t\tlead him to great heights of achievement, but may equally\n\t\t\t\twell lead him utterly astray: hence my free rendering of\n\t\t\t\tthis profound, elliptic phrase."

On the other hand, since adultery is an\n\t\t\t\tillicit sexual union, the verb yankihu, which appears\n\t\t\t\ttwice in this passage, cannot have the customary,\n\t\t\t\tspecific meaning of \"he marries\" but must, rather, be\n\t\t\t\tunderstood in its general sense - applicable to both\n\t\t\t\tlawful and unlawful sexual intercourse - namely, \"he\n\t\t\t\tcouples with\". It is in this sense that the great\n\t\t\t\tcommentator Abu Muslim (as quoted by Razi) explains the\n\t\t\t\tabove verse, which stresses the fact that both partners\n\t\t\t\tare equally guilty inasmuch as they commit their sin\n\t\t\t\tconsciously - implying that neither of them can excuse\n\t\t\t\thimself or herself on the ground of having been merely\n\t\t\t\t\"seduced\"."

But precisely because a reference to\n\t\t\t\t\"camels\" would restrict its significance to people of a\n\t\t\t\tparticular environment and a particular time (without\n\t\t\t\teven the benefit of a historical allusion to past\n\t\t\t\tevents), it must be ruled out here, for the Qur\u0027anic\n\t\t\t\tappeals to observe the wonders of the God-created\n\t\t\t\tuniverse are invariably directed at people of all times\n\t\t\t\tand all environments. Hence, there is every reason to\n\t\t\t\tassume that the term ibil relates here not to camels but\n\t\t\t\tto \"clouds pregnant with water\": the more so as such an\n\t\t\t\tallusion to the miraculous, cyclic process of the\n\t\t\t\tevaporation of water, the skyward ascension of vapour,\n\t\t\t\tits condensation and, finally, its precipitation over the\n\t\t\t\tearth is definitely more in tune with the subsequent\n\t\t\t\tmention (in verses {18-20}) of sky, mountains and earth,\n\t\t\t\tthan would be a reference to \"camels\", however admirable\n\t\t\t\tand noteworthy these animals may be."

The assumption that the person\n\t\t\t\tspoken of in the Qur\u0027an as Haman was indeed the high\n\t\t\t\tpriest of the cult of Amon is strengthened by Pharaoh\u0027s\n\t\t\t\tdemand (mentioned in verse {38} of this surah as well as\n\t\t\t\tin {40:36-37}) that Haman erect for him \"a lofty tower\"\n\t\t\t\tfrom which he could \"have a look at [or \"ascend to\"] the\n\t\t\t\tgod of Moses\": which may be, among other things, an\n\t\t\t\tallusion to the hieratic purpose of the great pyramids of\n\t\t\t\tEgypt and to the function of the high priest as their\n\t\t\t\tchief architect.

This\n\t\t\t\tdesignation is almost certainly a corruption of\n\t\t\t\tPeriklytos (\"the Much-Praised\"), an exact Greek\n\t\t\t\ttranslation of the Aramaic term or name Mawhamana. (It is\n\t\t\t\tto be borne in mind that Aramaic was the language used in\n\t\t\t\tPalestine at the time of, and for some centuries after,\n\t\t\t\tJesus, and was thus undoubtedly the language in which the\n\t\t\t\toriginal - now lost - texts of the Gospels were\n\t\t\t\tcomposed.) In view of the phonetic closeness of\n\t\t\t\tPeriklytos and Parakletos it is easy to understand how\n\t\t\t\tthe translator - or, more probably, a later scribe -\n\t\t\t\tconfused these two expressions. It is significant that\n\t\t\t\tboth the Aramaic Mawhamana and the Greek Periklytos have\n\t\t\t\tthe same meaning as the two names of the Last Prophet,\n\t\t\t\tMuhammad and Ahmad, both of which are derived from the\n\t\t\t\tverb hamida (\"he praised\") and the noun hamd (\"praise\").\n\t\t\t\tAn even more unequivocal prediction of the advent of the\n\t\t\t\tProphet Muhammad - mentioned by name, in its Arabic form\n\t\t\t\t- is said to be forthcoming from the so-called Gospel of\n\t\t\t\tSt. Barnabas, which, though now regarded as apocryphal,\n\t\t\t\twas accepted as authentic and was read in the churches\n\t\t\t\tuntil the year 496 of the Christian era, when it was\n\t\t\t\tbanned as \"heretical\" by a decree of Pope Gelasius.\n\t\t\t\tHowever, since the original text of that Gospel is not\n\t\t\t\tavailable (having come down to us only in an Italian\n\t\t\t\ttranslation dating from the late sixteenth century), its\n\t\t\t\tauthenticity cannot be established with certainty."

Since such a complete\n\t\t\t\tevidence is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to\n\t\t\t\tobtain, it is obvious that the purpose of the above\n\t\t\t\tQur\u0027anic injunction is to preclude, in practice, all\n\t\t\t\tthird-party accusations relating to illicit sexual\n\t\t\t\tintercourse - for, \"man has been created weak\" ({4: 28})\n\t\t\t\t- and to make a proof of adultery dependent on a\n\t\t\t\tvoluntary, faith-inspired confession of the guilty\n\t\t\t\tparties themselves."

        "Body":  "This is probably the earliest occurrence of the term\n\t\t\t\tmunafiq in the chronology of Qur\u0027anic revelation.\n\t\t\t\tIdiomatically, the term is derived from the noun nafaq,\n\t\t\t\twhich denotes an \"underground passage\" having an outlet\n\t\t\t\tdifferent from the entry, and signifying, specifically,\n\t\t\t\tthe complicated burrow of a field-mouse, a lizard, etc.,\n\t\t\t\tfrom which the animal can easily escape or in which it\n\t\t\t\tcan outwit a pursuer. Tropically, the term munafiq\n\t\t\t\tdescribes a person who is \"two-faced\", inasmuch as he\n\t\t\t\talways tries to find an easy way out of any real\n\t\t\t\tcommitment, be it spiritual or social, by adapting his\n\t\t\t\tcourse of action to what promises to be of practical\n\t\t\t\tadvantage to him in the situation in which he happens to\n\t\t\t\tfind himself. Since a person thus characterized usually\n\t\t\t\tpretends to be morally better than he really is, the\n\t\t\t\tepithet munafiq may roughly be rendered as \"hypocrite\".\n\t\t\t\tIt should, however, be noted that whereas this Western\n\t\t\t\tterm invariably implies conscious dissembling with the\n\t\t\t\tintent to deceive others, the Arabic term mun afiq may\n\t\t\t\talso be applied - and occasionally is applied in the\n\t\t\t\tQur\u0027an - to a person who, being weak or uncertain in his\n\t\t\t\tbeliefs or moral convictions, merely deceives himself.\n\t\t\t\tHence, while using in my rendering of the Qur\u0027anic text\n\t\t\t\tthe conventional expression \"hypocrite\", I have\n\t\t\t\tendeavoured to point out the above differentiation,\n\t\t\t\twhenever possible and necessary, in my explanatory notes."

This view of the classical\n\t\t\t\tcommentators, however, does not seem to take into account\n\t\t\t\tthe many Qur\u0027anic passages which do not deal with\n\t\t\t\tmetaphysical subjects and yet are, undoubtedly,\n\t\t\t\tallegorical in intent and expression. To my mind, one\n\t\t\t\tcannot arrive at a correct understanding of the above\n\t\t\t\tpassage without paying due attention to the nature and\n\t\t\t\tfunction of allegory as such. A true allegory - in\n\t\t\t\tcontrast with a mere pictorial paraphrase of something\n\t\t\t\tthat could equally well be stated in direct terms - is\n\t\t\t\talways meant to express in a figurative manner something\n\t\t\t\twhich, because of its complexity, cannot be adequately\n\t\t\t\texpressed in direct terms or propositions and, because of\n\t\t\t\tthis very complexity, can be grasped only intuitively, as\n\t\t\t\ta general mental image, and not as a series of detailed\n\t\t\t\t\"statements\": and this seems to be the meaning of the\n\t\t\t\tphrase, \"none save God knows its final meaning\"."

According to some commentators, however (e.g.,\n\t\t\t\tManar III, 234), the above Qur\u0027anic passage has a general\n\t\t\t\timport and alludes to an occurrence often witnessed in\n\t\t\t\thistory - namely, the victory of a numerically weak and\n\t\t\t\till-equipped group of people, filled with a burning\n\t\t\t\tbelief in the righteousness of their cause, over a\n\t\t\t\tmaterially and numerically superior enemy lacking a\n\t\t\t\tsimilar conviction. The fact that in this Qur\u0027an-verse\n\t\t\t\tthe believers are spoken of as being faced by an enemy\n\t\t\t\t\"twice their number\" (while at the battle of Badr the\n\t\t\t\tpagan Quraysh were more than three times the number of\n\t\t\t\tthe Muslims) lends great plausibility to this explanation\n\t\t\t\t- and particularly so in view of the allusion, in the\n\t\t\t\tnext verse, to material riches and worldly power."

        "Body":  "As I have pointed out on more than one occasion, every\n\t\t\t\tverse of the Qur\u0027an must be read and interpreted against\n\t\t\t\tthe background of the Qur\u0027an as a whole. The above verse,\n\t\t\t\twhich speaks of a possible conversion to Islam on the\n\t\t\t\tpart of \"those who ascribe divinity to aught beside God\"\n\t\t\t\twith whom the believers are at war, must, therefore, be\n\t\t\t\tconsidered in conjunction with several fundamental\n\t\t\t\tQur\u0027anic ordinances. One of them, \"There shall be no\n\t\t\t\tcoercion in matters of faith\" (\u003ca href=\u0027qa:2.256\u0027\u003e2:256\u003c/a\u003e), lays down\n\t\t\t\tcategorically that any attempt at a forcible conversion\n\t\t\t\tof unbelievers is prohibited - which precludes the\n\t\t\t\tpossibility of the Muslims\u0027 demanding or expecting that a\n\t\t\t\tdefeated enemy should embrace Islam as the price of\n\t\t\t\timmunity. Secondly, the Qur\u0027an ordains, \"Fight in God\u0027s\n\t\t\t\tcause against those who wage war against you; but do not\n\t\t\t\tcommit aggression, for verily, God does not love\n\t\t\t\taggressors\" (\u003ca href=\u0027qa:2.190\u0027\u003e2:190\u003c/a\u003e); and, \"if they do not let you be,\n\t\t\t\tand do not offer you peace, and do not stay their hands,\n\t\t\t\tseize them and slay them whenever you come upon them: and\n\t\t\t\tit is against these that We have clearly empowered you\n\t\t\t\t[to make war]\" (\u003ca href=\u0027qa:4.91\u0027\u003e4:91\u003c/a\u003e). Thus, war is permissible only in\n\t\t\t\tself-defence (see surah {2}, notes [167] and [168]), with\n\t\t\t\tthe further proviso that \"if they desist - behold, God is\n\t\t\t\tmuch-forgiving, a dispenser of grace\" (\u003ca href=\u0027qa:2.192\u0027\u003e2:192\u003c/a\u003e), and \"if\n\t\t\t\tthey desist, then all hostility shall cease\" (\u003ca href=\u0027qa:2.193\u0027\u003e2:193\u003c/a\u003e).\n\t\t\t\tNow the enemy\u0027s conversion to Islam - expressed in the\n\t\t\t\twords, \"if they repent, and take to prayer [lit.,\n\t\t\t\t\"establish prayer\"] and render the purifying dues\n\t\t\t\t(zakah)\" - is no more than one, and by no means the only,\n\t\t\t\tway of their \"desisting from hostility\"; and the\n\t\t\t\treference to it in verses {5} and {11} of this surah\n\t\t\t\tcertainly does not imply an alternative of \"conversion or\n\t\t\t\tdeath\", as some unfriendly critics of Islam choose to\n\t\t\t\tassume. Verses {4} and {6} give a further elucidation of\n\t\t\t\tthe attitude which the believers are enjoined to adopt\n\t\t\t\ttowards such of the unbelievers as are not hostile to\n\t\t\t\tthem.

The classical commentators adopt, as a rule, the\n\t\t\t\tfirst sense and, consequently, interpret the passage\n\t\t\t\tthus: \"...the two angels that are charged with recording\n\t\t\t\tman\u0027s doings do record them, sitting on his right and on\n\t\t\t\this left\". In my opinion, however, the second of the two\n\t\t\t\tpossible meanings (\"the two that aim at meeting each\n\t\t\t\tother\") corresponds better with the preceding verse,\n\t\t\t\twhich speaks of what man\u0027s innermost self (nafs)\n\t\t\t\t\"whispers within him\", i.e., voices his subconscious\n\t\t\t\tdesires. Thus, \"the two that aim at meeting\" are, I\n\t\t\t\tbelieve, the two demands of, or, more properly, the two\n\t\t\t\tfundamental motive forces within man\u0027s nature: his\n\t\t\t\tprimal, instinctive urges and desires, both sensual and\n\t\t\t\tnon-sensual (all of them comprised in the modern\n\t\t\t\tpsychological term \"libido\"), on the one side, and his\n\t\t\t\treason, both intuitive and reflective, on the other. The\n\t\t\t\t\"sitting (qa\u0027id) on the right and on the left\" is, to my\n\t\t\t\tmind, a metaphor for the conflicting nature of these dual\n\t\t\t\tforces which strive for predominance within every human\n\t\t\t\tbeing: hence, my rendering of qa\u0027id as \"contending\". This\n\t\t\t\tinterpretation is, moreover, strongly supported by the\n\t\t\t\treference, in verse {21}, to man\u0027s appearing on Judgment\n\t\t\t\tDay with \"that which drives and that which bears witness\"\n\t\t\t\t- a phrase which undoubtedly alludes to man\u0027s instinctive\n\t\t\t\turges as well as his conscious reason (see note [14]\n\t\t\t\tbelow)."

The\n\t\t\t\tQuraysh took this stipulation to include also married\n\t\t\t\twomen, whom they considered to be under the\n\t\t\t\t\"guardianship\" of their husbands. Accordingly, when\n\t\t\t\tseveral Meccan women embraced Islam against the will of\n\t\t\t\ttheir husbands and fled to Medina, the Quraysh demanded\n\t\t\t\ttheir forcible return to Mecca. This the Prophet refused\n\t\t\t\ton the grounds that married women did not fall within the\n\t\t\t\tcategory of \"persons under guardianship\". However, since\n\t\t\t\tthere was always the possibility that some of these women\n\t\t\t\thad gone over to the Muslims not for reasons of faith but\n\t\t\t\tout of purely worldly considerations, the believers were\n\t\t\t\tenjoined to make sure of their sincerity; and so, the\n\t\t\t\tProphet asked each of them: \"Swear before God that thou\n\t\t\t\tdidst not leave because of hatred of thy husband, or out\n\t\t\t\tof a desire to go to another country, or in the hope of\n\t\t\t\tattaining to worldly advantages: swear before God that\n\t\t\t\tthou didst not leave for any reason save the love of God\n\t\t\t\tand His Apostle\" (Tabari). Since God alone knows what is\n\t\t\t\tin the heart of a human being, a positive response of the\n\t\t\t\twoman concerned was to be regarded as the only humanly\n\t\t\t\tattainable - and, therefore, legally sufficient - proof\n\t\t\t\tof her sincerity. The fact that God alone is really aware\n\t\t\t\tof what is in a human being\u0027s heart is incorporated in\n\t\t\t\tthe shar\u0027i principle that any adult person\u0027s declaration\n\t\t\t\tof faith, in the absence of any evidence to the contrary,\n\t\t\t\tmakes it mandatory upon the community to accept that\n\t\t\t\tperson - whether man or woman - as a Muslim on the basis\n\t\t\t\tof this declaration alone."

Hence, too, the \"bearing\n\t\t\t\taloft\" of the throne of His almightiness cannot be\n\t\t\t\tanything but a metaphor - namely, an allusion to the full\n\t\t\t\tmanifestation of that almightiness on the Day of\n\t\t\t\tJudgment. The Qur\u0027an is silent as to who or what the\n\t\t\t\t\"eight\" are on whom this manifestation rests. Some of the\n\t\t\t\tearliest commentators assume that they are eight angels;\n\t\t\t\tothers, that they are eight ranks of angels; while still\n\t\t\t\tothers frankly admit that it is impossible to say whether\n\t\t\t\t\"eight\" or \"eight thousand\" are meant (Al-Hasan al-Basri,\n\t\t\t\tas quoted by Zamakhshari).

The Prophet\u0027s wife \u0027A\u0027ishah, who had\n\t\t\t\taccompanied him on that expedition, was inadvertently\n\t\t\t\tleft behind when the Muslims struck camp before dawn.\n\t\t\t\tAfter having spent several hours alone, she was found by\n\t\t\t\tone of the Prophet\u0027s Companions, who led her to the next\n\t\t\t\thalting-place of the army.

At the\n\t\t\t\tinstigation of the Jewish tribe of Banu \u0027n-Nadir, who had\n\t\t\t\tbeen expelled from Yathrib (Medina) after they had broken\n\t\t\t\tthe treaty binding them to the Muslims, several of the\n\t\t\t\tmost powerful Abrabian tribes formed a confederacy with a\n\t\t\t\tview to overcoming, once and for all, the threat posed by\n\t\t\t\tIslam to the beliefs and many of the customs of pagan\n\t\t\t\tArabia. In the month of Shawwal, 5 H., a force of well\n\t\t\t\tover 12,000 men, composed of the Quraysh and their allies\n\t\t\t\t- the Banu Kinanah, Banu Asad and the people of the\n\t\t\t\tcoastlands (the Tihamah), as well as the great Najdi\n\t\t\t\ttribe of Ghatafan and its allies, the Hawazin (or Banu\n\t\t\t\t\u0027Amir) and Banu Sulaym - converged upon Medina.\n\t\t\t\tForewarned of their coming, the Prophet had ordered a\n\t\t\t\tdeep trench to be dug around the town - a defensive\n\t\t\t\tmeasure unknown in pre-Islamic Arabia - and thus brought\n\t\t\t\tthe assault of the Confederates to a halt. At that point,\n\t\t\t\thowever, another danger arose for the Muslims: the Jewish\n\t\t\t\ttribe of Banu Qurayzah, who lived in the outskirts of\n\t\t\t\tMedina and until then had been allied with the Muslims,\n\t\t\t\tbroke the treaty of alliance and openly joined the\n\t\t\t\tConfederates. Nevertheless, during a siege lasting\n\t\t\t\tseveral weeks all the attempts of the latter to cross the\n\t\t\t\ttrench - manned by the numerically much weaker and less\n\t\t\t\twell-armed Muslims - were repulsed with heavy losses to\n\t\t\t\tthe attackers; dissensions, based on mutual distrust,\n\t\t\t\tgradually undermined the much-vaunted alliance between\n\t\t\t\tthe Jewish and the pagan Arab tribes; in the month of Dhu\n\t\t\t\t\u0027l-Qa\u0027dah their frustration became complete when a\n\t\t\t\tbitterly-cold stormwind raged for several days, making\n\t\t\t\tlife unbearable even for hardened warriors. And so,\n\t\t\t\tfinally, the siege was raised and the Confederates\n\t\t\t\tdispersed, thus ending the last attempt of the pagans to\n\t\t\t\tdestroy the Prophet and his community."

Thus,\n\t\t\t\tthe purport [of this passage] is but an illustration\n\t\t\t\t(taswir) of the effect of His almighty power on all that\n\t\t\t\tis willed [by Him], and nothing else...\" (It is obvious\n\t\t\t\tthat Zamakhahari\u0027s reasoning is based on the oft-repeated\n\t\t\t\tQur\u0027anic statement, \"When God wills a thing to be, He but\n\t\t\t\tsays unto it, \u0027Be\u0027 - and it is.\") Concluding his\n\t\t\t\tinterpretation of the above passage, Zamakshari adds: \"If\n\t\t\t\tI am asked about the meaning of [the words] \u0027willingly or\n\t\t\t\tunwillingly\u0027, I say that it is a figurative expression\n\t\t\t\t(mathal) indicating that His almighty will must\n\t\t\t\tinevitably take effect.\""

Quite apart from the\n\t\t\t\timpossibility of admitting that any passage of the Qur\u0027an\n\t\t\t\tcould have been \"abrogated\" by another of its passages\n\t\t\t\t(see surah {2}, note [87]), the expression fahishah does\n\t\t\t\tnot, by itself, connote illicit sexual intercourse: it\n\t\t\t\tsignifies anything that is grossly immodest, unseemly,\n\t\t\t\tlewd, indecent or abominable in word or in deed (cf. Lane\n\t\t\t\tVI, 2344f.), and is by no means restricted to sexual\n\t\t\t\ttransgressions.

When he was asked to\n\t\t\t\texplain the meaning of \"tribal partisanship\", the Prophet\n\t\t\t\tanswered, \"It means helping thine own people in an unjust\n\t\t\t\tcause\" (ibid., on authority of Wathilah ibn al-Aqsa\u0027)."

Now from the\n\t\t\t\ttotality of the Qur\u0027anic teachings it becomes apparent\n\t\t\t\tthat the innermost purpose of all true faith is, firstly,\n\t\t\t\ta realization of the existence of God and of every human\n\t\t\t\tbeing\u0027s responsibility to Him; secondly, man\u0027s attaining\n\t\t\t\tto a consciousness of his own dignity as a positive\n\t\t\t\telement - a logically necessary element - in God\u0027s plan\n\t\t\t\tof creation and, thus, achieving freedom from all manner\n\t\t\t\tof superstitions and irrational fears; and, lastly,\n\t\t\t\tmaking man aware that whatever good or evil he does is\n\t\t\t\tbut done for the benefit, or to the detriment, of his own\n\t\t\t\tself (as expressed in verse {15} above)."

As\n\t\t\t\tin the parallel account of this parable of the Fall in\n\t\t\t\t{2:35-36}, the dual form of address changes at this stage\n\t\t\t\tinto the plural, thus connecting once again with verse\n\t\t\t\t{10} and the beginning of verse {11} of this surah, and\n\t\t\t\tmaking it clear that the story of Adam and Eve is, in\n\t\t\t\treality, an allegory of human destiny. In his earlier\n\t\t\t\tstate of innocence man was unaware of the existence of\n\t\t\t\tevil and, therefore, of the ever-present necessity of\n\t\t\t\tmaking a choice between the many possibilities of action\n\t\t\t\tand behaviour: in other words, he lived, like all other\n\t\t\t\tanimals, in the light of his instincts alone. Inasmuch,\n\t\t\t\thowever, as this innocence was only a condition of his\n\t\t\t\texistence and not a virtue, it gave to his life a static\n\t\t\t\tquality and thus precluded him from moral and\n\t\t\t\tintellectual development The growth of his consciousness\n\t\t\t\t- symbolized by the wilful act of disobedience to God\u0027s\n\t\t\t\tcommand - changed all this. It transformed him from a\n\t\t\t\tpurely instinctive being into a full-fledged human entity\n\t\t\t\tas we know it - a human being capable of discerning\n\t\t\t\tbetween right and wrong and thus of choosing his way of\n\t\t\t\tlife. In this deeper sense, the allegory of the Fall does\n\t\t\t\tnot describe a retrogressive happening but, rather, a new\n\t\t\t\tstage of human development: an opening of doors to moral\n\t\t\t\tconsiderations. By forbidding him to \"approach this\n\t\t\t\ttree\", God made it possible for man to act wrongly - and\n\t\t\t\ttherefore, to act rightly as well: and so man became\n\t\t\t\tendowed with that moral free will which distinguishes him\n\t\t\t\tfrom all other sentient beings. - Regarding the role of\n\t\t\t\tSatan - or Iblis - as the eternal tempter of man, see\n\t\t\t\tnote [26] on \u003ca href=\u0027qa:2.34\u0027\u003e2:34\u003c/a\u003e and note [31] on \u003ca href=\u0027qa:15.41\u0027\u003e15:41\u003c/a\u003e."

But quite apart\n\t\t\t\tfrom the fact that all Qur\u0027anic allegories of the joys of\n\t\t\t\tparadise invariably apply to men and women alike, this\n\t\t\t\tinterpretation of kawa\u0027ib overlooks the purely derivative\n\t\t\t\torigin of the above popular usage - which is based on the\n\t\t\t\ttropical connotation of \"prominence\" inherent in the noun\n\t\t\t\tka\u0027b - and substitutes for this obvious tropism the\n\t\t\t\tliteral meaning of something that is physically\n\t\t\t\tprominent: and this, in my opinion, is utterly\n\t\t\t\tunjustified. If we bear in mind that the Qur\u0027anic\n\t\t\t\tdescriptions of the blessings of paradise are always\n\t\t\t\tallegorical, we realize that in the above context the\n\t\t\t\tterm kawa\u0027ib can have no other meaning than \"glorious [or\n\t\t\t\t\"splendid\"] beings\", without any definition of sex; and\n\t\t\t\tthat, in combination with the term atrab, it denotes,\n\t\t\t\t\"splendid companions well-matched\" - thus alluding to the\n\t\t\t\trelations of the blest with one another, and stressing\n\t\t\t\tthe absolute mutual compatibility and equal dignity of\n\t\t\t\tall of them.

(See in this connection\n\t\t\t\tsurah {3}, note [37], and surah {7}, note [95].) It\n\t\t\t\tshould, however, be borne in mind that the Qur\u0027anic\n\t\t\t\tconcept of \"destiny\" relates not so much to the external\n\t\t\t\tcircumstances of and events in man\u0027s life as, rather, to\n\t\t\t\tthe direction which this life takes in result of one\u0027s\n\t\t\t\tmoral choices: in other words, it relates to man\u0027s\n\t\t\t\tspiritual fate-and this, in its turn, depends-as the\n\t\t\t\tQur\u0027an so often points out-on a person\u0027s inclinations,\n\t\t\t\tattitudes and conscious actions (including self-restraint\n\t\t\t\tfrom morally bad actions or, alternatively, a deliberate\n\t\t\t\tomission of good actions).

The\n\t\t\t\tdeliberate omission of any explanatory reference in this\n\t\t\t\tconnection suggests that the expression \"bond with God\"\n\t\t\t\tstands for something that is rooted in the human\n\t\t\t\tsituation as such, and can, therefore, be perceived\n\t\t\t\tinstinctively as well as through conscious experience:\n\t\t\t\tnamely, that innate relationship with God which makes Him\n\t\t\t\t\"closer to man than his neck-vein\" (\u003ca href=\u0027qa:50.16\u0027\u003e50:16\u003c/a\u003e). For an\n\t\t\t\texplanation of the subsequent reference to \"what God has\n\t\t\t\tbidden to be joined\", see surah {13}, note [43]."

Since the verb rama (lit., \"he\n\t\t\t\tcast\" or \"flung\") applies also to the act of \"shooting an\n\t\t\t\tarrow\" or \"flinging a spear\", it might be explained here\n\t\t\t\tas a reference to the Prophet\u0027s active participation in\n\t\t\t\tthe battle. Alternatively, it may denote his \"casting\n\t\t\t\tterror\", i.e., into the hearts of his enemies, by his and\n\t\t\t\this followers\u0027 extreme valour. Whichever explanation is\n\t\t\t\tadopted, the above verse implies that the victory of the\n\t\t\t\tMuslims over the much more numerous and much better\n\t\t\t\tequipped army of the Quraysh was due to God\u0027s grace\n\t\t\t\talone: and, thus, it is a reminder to the faithful, of\n\t\t\t\tall times, not to indulge in undue pride in any of their\n\t\t\t\tachievements (which is the meaning of the \"test\"\n\t\t\t\tmentioned in the next sentence)."

As regards the latter, it is to be borne in\n\t\t\t\tmind that its primary significance is \"a group\" or \"a\n\t\t\t\tcongregated body of men\" - more or less synonymous with\n\t\t\t\tta\u0027ifah or jama\u0027ah; it can, therefore, be used to denote\n\t\t\t\t\"an army\" as well as \"a community\".

But while both\n\t\t\t\tinterpretations of the above verse are linguistically\n\t\t\t\tjustified, the one adopted by me (and supported,\n\t\t\t\taccording to Ibn Kathir, by Ubayy ibn Ka\u0027b) is in greater\n\t\t\t\tharmony with the context, inasmuch as both the preceding\n\t\t\t\tand subsequent passages are unmistakably addressed to the\n\t\t\t\tbelievers. Thus, the verse must be understood as a\n\t\t\t\treminder to the Muslims that God will be with them only\n\t\t\t\tso long as they remain firm in faith and righteous in\n\t\t\t\taction, and that, however large their community may be in\n\t\t\t\tthe future, they will be powerless unless they are true\n\t\t\t\tbelievers."

In his commentary on this\n\t\t\t\tverse, Razi suggests that the expression ma\u0027 sadid is\n\t\t\t\there purely metaphorical, and should be understood as\n\t\t\t\t\"water like [what is described as] ,sadid\".

In the form in which it has been\n\t\t\t\thanded down from the earliest authorities (including,\n\t\t\t\taccording to Tabari and Baghawi, Companions like \u0027Abd\n\t\t\t\tAllah ibn\u0027Abbas and Anas ibn Malik, as well as several of\n\t\t\t\tthe most prominent of their immediate successors), the\n\t\t\t\tstory contradicts the doctrine - somewhat arbitrarily\n\t\t\t\tdeveloped by Muslim theologians in the course of the\n\t\t\t\tcenturies - that prophets cannot sin by virtue of their\n\t\t\t\tvery nature, and tends to show that their purity and\n\t\t\t\tsubsequent sinlessness is a result of inner struggles and\n\t\t\t\ttrials and, thus, represents in each case a moral\n\t\t\t\tachievement rather than an inborn quality. As narrated in\n\t\t\t\tsome detail by Tabari and other early commentators, David\n\t\t\t\tfell in love with a beautiful woman whom he accidentally\n\t\t\t\tobserved from his roof terrace. On inquiring, he was told\n\t\t\t\tthat she was the wife of one of his officers, named\n\t\t\t\tUriah. Impelled by his passion, David ordered his\n\t\t\t\tfield-commander to place Uriah in a particularly exposed\n\t\t\t\tbattle position, where he would be certain to be killed;\n\t\t\t\tand as soon as his order was fulfilled and Uriah died,\n\t\t\t\tDavid married the widow (who subsequently became the\n\t\t\t\tmother of Solomon). This story agrees more or less with\n\t\t\t\tthe Old Testament, which gives the woman\u0027s name as\n\t\t\t\tBath-Sheba (II Samuel xi), barring the Biblical\n\t\t\t\tallegation that David committed adultery with her before\n\t\t\t\tUriah\u0027s death (ibid. xi, 4-5) - an allegation which has\n\t\t\t\talways been rejected by Muslims as highly offensive and\n\t\t\t\tslanderous: cf. the saying of the fourth Caliph, \u0027Ali ibn\n\t\t\t\tAbi Talib (quoted by Zamakhshari on the authority of\n\t\t\t\tSa\u0027id ibn al-Musayyab): \"If anyone should narrate the\n\t\t\t\tstory of David in the manner in which the story-tellers\n\t\t\t\tnarrate it, I will have him flogged with one hundred and\n\t\t\t\tsixty stripes - for this is a [suitable] punishment for\n\t\t\t\tslandering prophets\" (thus indirectly recalling the\n\t\t\t\tQur\u0027anic ordinance, in \u003ca href=\u0027qa:24.4\u0027\u003e24:4\u003c/a\u003e, which stipulates flogging\n\t\t\t\twith eighty stripes for accusing ordinary persons of\n\t\t\t\tadultery without legal proof). According to most of the\n\t\t\t\tcommentators, the two \"litigants\" who suddenly appeared\n\t\t\t\tbefore David were angels sent to bring home to him his\n\t\t\t\tsin. It is possible, however, to see in their appearance\n\t\t\t\tan allegory of David\u0027s own realization of having sinned:\n\t\t\t\tvoices of his own conscience which at last \"surmounted\n\t\t\t\tthe walls\" of the passion that had blinded him for a\n\t\t\t\ttime."

As the construction of the sentence shows, this\n\t\t\t\tsalsal is stated to have evolved (Razi) out of hama\u0027 -\n\t\t\t\twhich, according to some authorities, is the plural of\n\t\t\t\tham\u0027ah, signifying \"dark, fetid mud\" or \"dark slime\" -\n\t\t\t\twhile the participial adjective masnun which qualifies\n\t\t\t\tthis noun denotes, as Razi points out, both \"altered\"\n\t\t\t\t(i.e., in its composition) and \"brought into shape\":\n\t\t\t\thence my rendering of this expression as \"transmuted\",\n\t\t\t\twhich to some extent combines both of the above meanings.\n\t\t\t\tTo my mind, we have here a description of the primeval\n\t\t\t\tbiological environment out of which the \"sounding clay\" -\n\t\t\t\tthe matrix, as it were - of man\u0027s physical body has\n\t\t\t\tevolved in accordance with God\u0027s plan of creation."

The\n\t\t\t\tstriking verbal identity of question and answer in the\n\t\t\t\ttwo passages is obviously not accidental: it points, in a\n\t\t\t\tdeliberately revealing manner, to the identity of the\n\t\t\t\tidea underlying these two allegories: namely, God\u0027s power\n\t\t\t\tto \"bring forth the living out of that which is dead, and\n\t\t\t\tthe dead out of that which is alive\" ({3: 27}, {6: 95},\n\t\t\t\t{10: 31}, {30: 19}), i.e., to create life, to cause it to\n\t\t\t\tdisappear and then to resurrect it.

The rendering of the\n\t\t\t\tabove passage hinges on the meaning given to the term\n\t\t\t\tmu\u0027aqqibat - a double plural of mu\u0027aqqib, which signifies\n\t\t\t\t\"something that comes immediately after another thing\" or\n\t\t\t\t\"succeeds another thing without interruption\". Most of\n\t\t\t\tthe classical commentators understand by mu\u0027aqqibat\n\t\t\t\t\"hosts of angels\", i.e., the recording angels who attend\n\t\t\t\ton every human being, succeeding one another without\n\t\t\t\tinterruption. Consequently, they interpret the phrase min\n\t\t\t\tbayni yadayhi wa-min khalfihi as meaning \"ranged before\n\t\t\t\thim and behind him\", i.e., surrounding man from all\n\t\t\t\tsides; and they explain the words \"from God\u0027s command\" as\n\t\t\t\tbeing here synonymous with \"by God\u0027s command\", and take\n\t\t\t\tthem to refer to the angels or to their function of\n\t\t\t\tguardianship. However, this interpretation has by no\n\t\t\t\tmeans the support of all the commentators. Some of the\n\t\t\t\tearliest ones assume that the term mu\u0027aqqibat refers to\n\t\t\t\tall manner of worldly forces or concepts on which man so\n\t\t\t\toften relies in the mistaken belief that they might help\n\t\t\t\thim to achieve his aims independently of God\u0027s will: and\n\t\t\t\tthis is the meaning given to this elliptic passage by the\n\t\t\t\tfamous commentator Abu Muslim al-Isfahani, as quoted by\n\t\t\t\tRazi. Explaining verse {10} and the first part of verse\n\t\t\t\t{11}, he says: \"All alike are, in God\u0027s knowledge, deeds\n\t\t\t\tdone secretly or openly, as well as he who hides in the\n\t\t\t\tdarkness of night and he who walks [boldly] in the light\n\t\t\t\tof day...: for he that resorts to the [cover of] night\n\t\t\t\tcan never elude God\u0027s will (amr), just as he [cannot]\n\t\t\t\tthat walks in the light of day, surrounded by hosts of\n\t\t\t\thelpers (mu\u0027aqqibat) - that is, guards and aids - meant\n\t\t\t\tto protect him: [for] those guards of his cannot save him\n\t\t\t\tfrom [the will of] God.\" It is on this convincing\n\t\t\t\tinterpretation that I have based my rendering. The\n\t\t\t\tworldly \"guards and aids\" on which a sinner relies may be\n\t\t\t\ttangible (like wealth, progeny, etc.) or intangible (like\n\t\t\t\tpersonal power, high social standing, or the belief in\n\t\t\t\tone\u0027s \"luck\"): and this explains the phrase \"both such as\n\t\t\t\tcan be perceived by him and such as are hidden from him\"\n\t\t\t\t(see preceding note)."

Hence, muqw denotes \"one who\n\t\t\t\tis hungry\" as well as \"one who is lost [or \"who wanders\"]\n\t\t\t\tin a deserted place\". In the above verse this expression\n\t\t\t\tis evidently used tropically, for it is difficult to\n\t\t\t\timagine that, as some commentators assume, it relates\n\t\t\t\tmerely to \"wayfarers in the desert\". My composite\n\t\t\t\trendering of al-muqwin as \"all who are lost and hungry in\n\t\t\t\tthe wilderness\", on the other hand, is literal and\n\t\t\t\ttropical at the same time, inasmuch as it describes\n\t\t\t\tpeople who are lonely, unfortunate and confused, and who\n\t\t\t\thunger after human warmth and spiritual light."

It is probable, however, that\n\t\t\t\tthis verse has yet another, deeper import. According to\n\t\t\t\tan authentic Tradition quoted by Muslim, Abu Da\u0027ud and\n\t\t\t\tIbn Hibban (as well as by Tabari), one of the Prophet\u0027s\n\t\t\t\tCompanions stated in the mosque of Medina, \"I would not\n\t\t\t\tcare, after having accepted Islam, to do any good deed\n\t\t\t\tbeyond providing water to the pilgrims!\" - whereupon\n\t\t\t\tanother of the Companions declared, \"Nay, [I would rather\n\t\t\t\ttake charge of] the maintenance of the Inviolable House\n\t\t\t\tof Worship.\" But yet another Companion declared, \"Nay,\n\t\t\t\tstruggle (jihad) in God\u0027s cause is far better than what\n\t\t\t\tyou have mentioned!\" A short time afterwards the above\n\t\t\t\tQur\u0027an-verse was revealed to the Prophet. It would,\n\t\t\t\ttherefore, appear that what is meant here is the superior\n\t\t\t\tvalue of faith in God and struggle in His cause as\n\t\t\t\tcompared with acts which, however meritorious, are\n\t\t\t\tconcerned only with outward forms: in brief, the immense\n\t\t\t\tsuperiority of real self-surrender to God over mere\n\t\t\t\tritual."

The word\n\t\t\t\tummah (of which umam is the plural) primarily denotes a\n\t\t\t\tgroup of living beings having certain characteristics or\n\t\t\t\tcircumstances in common. Thus, it is often synonymous\n\t\t\t\twith \"community\", \"people\", \"nation\", \"genus\"\n\t\t\t\t\"generation\", and so forth. Inasmuch as every such\n\t\t\t\tgrouping is characterized by the basic fact that its\n\t\t\t\tconstituents (whether human or animal) are endowed with\n\t\t\t\tlife, the term ummah sometimes signifies \"[God\u0027s]\n\t\t\t\tcreatures\" (Lisan al-\u0027Arab, with particular reference to\n\t\t\t\tthis very Qur\u0027an-verse; also Lane I, 90).

This anointment appears to have\n\t\t\t\tbeen so important a rite among the Hebrews that the term\n\t\t\t\t\"the anointed\" became in the course of time more or less\n\t\t\t\tsynonymous with \"king\". Its application to Jesus may have\n\t\t\t\tbeen due to the widespread conviction among his\n\t\t\t\tcontemporaries (references to which are found in several\n\t\t\t\tplaces in the Synoptic Gospels) that he was descended in\n\t\t\t\tdirect - and obviously legitimate - line from the royal\n\t\t\t\tHouse of David. (It is to be noted that this could not\n\t\t\t\thave related to his mother\u0027s side, because Mary belonged\n\t\t\t\tto the priestly class descending from Aaron, and thus to\n\t\t\t\tthe tribe of Levi, while David descended from the tribe\n\t\t\t\tof Judah.) Whatever may have been the historical\n\t\t\t\tcircumstances, it is evident that the honorific \"the\n\t\t\t\tAnointed\" was applied to Jesus in his own lifetime. In\n\t\t\t\tthe Greek version of the Gospels - which is undoubtedly\n\t\t\t\tbased on a now-lost Aramaic original - this designation\n\t\t\t\tis correctly translated as Christos (a noun derived from\n\t\t\t\tthe Greek verb chriein, \"to anoint\"): and since it is in\n\t\t\t\tthis form - \"the Christ\" - that the designation al-masih\n\t\t\t\thas achieved currency in all Western languages, I am\n\t\t\t\tusing it throughout in my translation."

As for the word jamal\n\t\t\t\toccurring in this sentence, there is hardly any doubt\n\t\t\t\tthat its translation, in this context, as \"camel\" is\n\t\t\t\terroneous. As pointed out by Zamakhshari (and confirmed\n\t\t\t\tby other classical commentators, including Razi), Ibn\n\t\t\t\t\u0027Abbas used to read the word in the spelling jummal,\n\t\t\t\twhich signifies \"a thick rope\" or \"a twisted cable\"; and\n\t\t\t\tthe same reading is attributed to \u0027Ali ibn Abi Talib (Taj\n\t\t\t\tal-\u0027Arus). It is to be noted that there are also several\n\t\t\t\tother dialectical spellings of this word, namely, jumal,\n\t\t\t\tjuml, jumul and, finally, jamal (as in the\n\t\t\t\tgenerally-accepted version of the Qur\u0027an) - all of them\n\t\t\t\tsignifying \"a thick, twisted rope\" (Jawhari), and all of\n\t\t\t\tthem used in this sense by some of the Prophet\u0027s\n\t\t\t\tCompanions or their immediate successors (tabi\u0027un). Ibn\n\t\t\t\t\u0027Abbas is also quoted by Zamakhshari as having said that\n\t\t\t\tGod could not have coined so inappropriate a metaphor as\n\t\t\t\t\"a camel passing through a needle\u0027s eye\" - meaning that\n\t\t\t\tthere is no relationship whatsoever between a camel and a\n\t\t\t\tneedle\u0027s eye whereas, on the other hand, there is a\n\t\t\t\tdefinite relationship between the latter and a rope\n\t\t\t\t(which after all, is but an extremely thick thread). On\n\t\t\t\tall accounts, therefore, the rendering of jamal as \"a\n\t\t\t\ttwisted rope\" is, in this context, infinitely preferable\n\t\t\t\tto that of \"a camel\". The fact that the latter rendering\n\t\t\t\toccurs in a somewhat similar phrase in the Greek version\n\t\t\t\tof the Synoptic Gospels (Matthew xix, 24, Mark x, 25 and\n\t\t\t\tLuke xviii, 25) does not affect this contention. One\n\t\t\t\tshould remember that the Gospels were originally composed\n\t\t\t\tin Aramaic, the language of Palestine at the time of\n\t\t\t\tJesus, and that those Aramaic texts are now lost. It is\n\t\t\t\tmore than probable that, owing to the customary absence\n\t\t\t\tof vowel signs in Aramaic writing, the Greek translator\n\t\t\t\tmisunderstood the consonant spelling g-m-l (corresponding\n\t\t\t\tto the Arabic j-m-l), and took it to mean \"a camel\": a\n\t\t\t\tmistake repeated since, with regard to the above\n\t\t\t\tQur\u0027an-verse, by many Muslims and all non-Muslim\n\t\t\t\torientalists as well."

It should also\n\t\t\t\tbe remembered that the concept of \"hell\" as such is\n\t\t\t\treferred to in the Qur\u0027an under seven different names,\n\t\t\t\tall of them metaphorical (necessarily so, because they\n\t\t\t\trelate to what the Qur\u0027an describes as al-ghayb,\n\t\t\t\t\"something that is beyond the reach of human\n\t\t\t\tperception\"): namely nar (\"fire, which is the general\n\t\t\t\tterm), jahannam (\"hell\"), jahim (\"blazing fire\"), sa\u0027ir\n\t\t\t\t(\"blazing flame\"), saqar (\"hell-fire\"), laza (\"raging\n\t\t\t\tflame\"), and hutamah (\"crushing torment\"). Since, as I\n\t\t\t\thave mentioned, these designations of other-worldly\n\t\t\t\tsuffering are obviously allegorical, we may also assume\n\t\t\t\tthat the \"seven gates of hell\" have the same character,\n\t\t\t\tand signify \"seven approaches [or \"ways\"] to hell\".\n\t\t\t\tFurthermore, it is well known that in the Semitic\n\t\t\t\tlanguages - and most particularly in classical Arabic -\n\t\t\t\tthe number \"seven\" is often used in the sense of\n\t\t\t\t\"several\" or \"various\" (cf. Lisan al-\u0027Arab, Taj al -Arus,\n\t\t\t\tetc.): and so the above Qur\u0027anic phrase may well have the\n\t\t\t\tmeaning of \"various ways leading to hell\" - in other\n\t\t\t\twords, many ways of sinning."

        "NoteID":  35,
        "Body":  "This is the earliest mention of the term and concept of\n\t\t\t\triba in the chronology of Qur\u0027anic revelation. In its\n\t\t\t\tgeneral, linguistic sense, this term denotes an\n\t\t\t\t\"addition\" to or an \"increase\" of a thing over and above\n\t\t\t\tits original size or amount; in the terminology of the\n\t\t\t\tQur\u0027an, it signifies any unlawful addition, by way of\n\t\t\t\tinterest, to a sum of money or goods lent by one person\n\t\t\t\tor body of persons to another. Considering the problem in\n\t\t\t\tterms of the economic conditions prevailing at or before\n\t\t\t\ttheir time, most of the early Muslim jurists identified\n\t\t\t\tthis \"unlawful addition\" with profits obtained through\n\t\t\t\tany kind of interest-bearing loans irrespective of the\n\t\t\t\trate of interest and the economic motivation involved.\n\t\t\t\tWith all this - as is evidenced by the voluminous\n\t\t\t\tjuridical literature on this subject - Islamic scholars\n\t\t\t\thave not yet been able to reach an absolute agreement on\n\t\t\t\tthe definition of riba: a definition, that is, which\n\t\t\t\twould cover all conceivable legal situations and\n\t\t\t\tpositively respond to all the exigencies of a variable\n\t\t\t\teconomic environment. In the words of Ibn Kathir (in his\n\t\t\t\tcommentary on \u003ca href=\u0027qa:2.275\u0027\u003e2:275\u003c/a\u003e), \"the subject of riba is one of\n\t\t\t\tthe most difficult subjects for many of the scholars (ahl\n\t\t\t\tal-\u0027ilm)\". It should be borne in mind that the passage\n\t\t\t\tcondemning and prohibiting riba in legal terms\n\t\t\t\t({2:275-281}) was the last revelation received by the\n\t\t\t\tProphet, who died a few days later (cf. note [268] on\n\t\t\t\t\u003ca href=\u0027qa:2.281\u0027\u003e2:281\u003c/a\u003e; hence, the Companions had no opportunity to ask\n\t\t\t\thim about the shar\u0027i implications of the relevant\n\t\t\t\tinjunction - so much so that even \u0027Umar ibn al-Khattab is\n\t\t\t\treliably reported to have said: \" The last [of the\n\t\t\t\tQur\u0027an] that was revealed was the passage [lit., \"the\n\t\t\t\tverse\"] on riba; and, behold, the Apostle of God passed\n\t\t\t\taway without [lit., \"before\"] having explained its\n\t\t\t\tmeaning to us\" (Ibn Hanbal, on the authority of Sa\u0027id ibn\n\t\t\t\tal-Musayyab). Nevertheless, the severity with which the\n\t\t\t\tQur\u0027an condemns riba and those who practice it furnishes\n\t\t\t\t- especially when viewed against the background of\n\t\t\t\tmankind\u0027s economic experiences during the intervening\n\t\t\t\tcenturies - a sufficiently clear indication of its nature\n\t\t\t\tand its social as well as moral implications. Roughly\n\t\t\t\tspeaking, the opprobrium of riba (in the sense in which\n\t\t\t\tthis term is used in the Qur\u0027an and in many sayings of\n\t\t\t\tthe Prophet) attaches to profits obtained through\n\t\t\t\tinterest-bearing loans involving an exploitation of the\n\t\t\t\teconomically weak by the strong and resourceful: an\n\t\t\t\texploitation characterized by the fact that the lender,\n\t\t\t\twhile retaining full ownership of the capital loaned and\n\t\t\t\thaving no legal concern with the purpose for which it is\n\t\t\t\tto be used or with the manner of its use, remains\n\t\t\t\tcontractually assured of gain irrespective of any losses\n\t\t\t\twhich the borrower may suffer in conseqence of this\n\t\t\t\ttransaction. With this definition in mind, we realize\n\t\t\t\tthat the question as to what kinds of financial\n\t\t\t\ttransactions fall within the category of riba is, in the\n\t\t\t\tlast resort, a moral one, closely connected with the\n\t\t\t\tsocio-economic motivation underlying the mutual\n\t\t\t\trelationship of borrower and lender; and, stated in\n\t\t\t\tpurely economic terms, it is a question as to how profits\n\t\t\t\tand risks may be equitably shared by both partners to a\n\t\t\t\tloan transaction. It is, of course, impossible to answer\n\t\t\t\tthis double question in a rigid, once-for-all manner: our\n\t\t\t\tanswers must necessarily vary in accordance with the\n\t\t\t\tchanges to which man\u0027s social and technological\n\t\t\t\tdevelopment - and, thus, his economic environment - is\n\t\t\t\tsubject. Hence, while the Qur\u0027anic condemnation of the\n\t\t\t\tconcept and practice of riba is unequivocal and final,\n\t\t\t\tevery successive Muslim generation is faced with the\n\t\t\t\tchallenge of giving new dimensions and a fresh economic\n\t\t\t\tmeaning to this term which, for want of a better word,\n\t\t\t\tmay be rendered as \"usury\". - In the present instance\n\t\t\t\t(which, as I have mentioned, is the earliest in the\n\t\t\t\thistory of the Qur\u0027an), no clear-cut prohibition is as\n\t\t\t\tyet laid down; but the prohibition appearing in \u003ca href=\u0027qa:2.275\u0027\u003e2:275\u003c/a\u003e\n\t\t\t\tff. is already foreshadowed by the reference to the\n\t\t\t\timmoral hope of increasing one\u0027s own substance \"through\n\t\t\t\t[other] people\u0027s"

Thus, in the\n\t\t\t\tparabolic manner so beloved by him, Jesus intimated to\n\t\t\t\tthe children of Israel that out of the humble clay of\n\t\t\t\ttheir lives he would fashion for them the vision of a\n\t\t\t\tsoaring destiny, and that this vision, brought to life by\n\t\t\t\this God-given inspiration, would become their real\n\t\t\t\tdestiny by God\u0027s leave and by the strength of their faith\n\t\t\t\t(as pointed out at the end of this verse)."

It is the plural of \u0027urf, which\n\t\t\t\tprimarily denotes \"acknowledgement\" or \"discernment\", and\n\t\t\t\tis also used to denote the highest, or most elevated,\n\t\t\t\tpart of anything (because it is most easily discerned):\n\t\t\t\tfor instance, the \u0027urf of a cock is the coxcomb, that of\n\t\t\t\ta horse its mane, and so forth. On the basis of this\n\t\t\t\tidiomatic usage, many commentators assume that the a\u0027raf\n\t\t\t\treferred to here are \"elevated places\", like the heights\n\t\t\t\tof a wall or its ramparts, and identify it with the\n\t\t\t\t\"barrier\" (hijab) mentioned at the end of the preceding\n\t\t\t\tsentence. A far more likely interpretation, however, is\n\t\t\t\tforthcoming from the primary significance of the word\n\t\t\t\t\u0027urf and its plural a\u0027raf: namely, \"discernment\" and \"the\n\t\t\t\tfaculty of discernment\", respectively. This\n\t\t\t\tinterpretation has been adopted by some of the great,\n\t\t\t\tearly commentators of the Qur\u0027an, like Al-Hasan al-Basri\n\t\t\t\tand Az-Zajjaj, whose views Razi quotes with evident\n\t\t\t\tapproval. They state emphatically that the expression\n\t\t\t\t\u0027ala \u0027l-a\u0027raf is synonymous with \u0027ala ma\u0027rifah, that is,\n\t\t\t\t\"possessing knowledge\" or \"endowed with the faculty of\n\t\t\t\tdiscernment\" (i.e., between right and wrong), and that\n\t\t\t\tthe persons thus described are those who in their\n\t\t\t\tlifetime were able to discern between right and wrong\n\t\t\t\t(\"recognizing each by its mark\"), but did not definitely\n\t\t\t\tincline to either: in brief, the indifferent ones. Their\n\t\t\t\tlukewarm attitude has prevented them from doing either\n\t\t\t\tmuch good or much wrong - with the result that, as the\n\t\t\t\tnext sentence shows, they deserve neither paradise nor\n\t\t\t\thell. (Several Traditions to this effect are quoted by\n\t\t\t\tTabari as well as by Ibn Kathir in their commentaries on\n\t\t\t\tthis verse.) - The noun rijal (lit., \"men\") at the\n\t\t\t\tbeginning of the next sentence as well as in verse {48}\n\t\t\t\tobviously denotes \"persons\" of both sexes."

        "Body":  "If the particle illa preceding the above clause is given\n\t\t\t\tits usual meaning of \"except\" or \"unless it be\", the\n\t\t\t\tphrase ought to be rendered thus: \"unless it be [an act\n\t\t\t\tof] trade based on mutual agreement\". This formulation,\n\t\t\t\thowever, has baffled many a commentator: for, if taken\n\t\t\t\tliterally, it would imply that wrongful profits from\n\t\t\t\ttrading based on mutual agreement are excepted from the\n\t\t\t\tgeneral prohibition, \"Devour not one another\u0027s\n\t\t\t\tpossessions wrongfully\" - a supposition impossible to\n\t\t\t\tmaintain in view of the ethics postulated by the Qur\u0027an.\n\t\t\t\tTo obviate this difficulty, most of the commentators\n\t\t\t\texpress the opinion that the particle illa has in this\n\t\t\t\tcontext the meaning of \"but\", and that the clause ought\n\t\t\t\tto be understood as follows: \"but it is lawful for you to\n\t\t\t\tprofit from one another\u0027s possessions by way of\n\t\t\t\tlegitimate trade based on mutual agreement\". However,\n\t\t\t\tquite apart from the fact that this interpretation is\n\t\t\t\thighly laboured and artificial, it does not explain why\n\t\t\t\t\"legitimate trade\" should have been singled out here as a\n\t\t\t\tsole means of lawfully deriving economic benefits from\n\t\t\t\tone another - for, as Razi rightly points out in his\n\t\t\t\tcommentary on this verse, \"it is no less lawful to\n\t\t\t\tbenefit economically through a gift, a bequest, a legal\n\t\t\t\tinheritance, alms, a dower, or an indemnity for injuries\n\t\t\t\treceived: for there are, aside from trade, many ways of\n\t\t\t\tacquiring possessions [lawfully]\". Why, then, should\n\t\t\t\ttrade alone have been stressed? - and, moreover, stressed\n\t\t\t\tin a context not particularly devoted to matters of\n\t\t\t\ttrade? A really satisfactory answer to this puzzle can,\n\t\t\t\tin my opinion, be obtained only through a linguistic\n\t\t\t\tconsideration of the particle illa. Apart from its usual\n\t\t\t\tconnotation of \"except\" or \"unless it be\", it has\n\t\t\t\tsometimes - as has been pointed out in both Qamus and\n\t\t\t\tMughni - the meaning of the simple conjunction \"and\"\n\t\t\t\t(wa); similarly, if it is preceded by a negative clause,\n\t\t\t\tit can be synonymous with \"nor\" or \"and neither\" (wa-la):\n\t\t\t\tas, for instance, in {27:10-11}, \"no fear need the\n\t\t\t\tmessage-bearers have in My Presence, and neither (illa)\n\t\t\t\tneed he who...\", etc. Now if we apply this particular use\n\t\t\t\tof illa to the passage under consideration, we arrive at\n\t\t\t\tthe reading, \"nor [shall you do it] by means of trade\n\t\t\t\tbased on mutual agreement\", or simply, \"not even by way\n\t\t\t\tof trade based on mutual agreement\" - whereupon the\n\t\t\t\tmeaning immediately becomes obvious: the believers are\n\t\t\t\tprohibited from devouring another person\u0027s possessions\n\t\t\t\twrongfully even if that other person - being the weaker\n\t\t\t\tparty - agrees to such a deprivation or exploitation\n\t\t\t\tunder the stress of circumstances. The reading adopted by\n\t\t\t\tme logically connects, moreover, with verse {32}, which\n\t\t\t\tadmonishes the believers not to covet one another\u0027s\n\t\t\t\tpossessions."

This the Qur\u0027an refutes by alluding to the\n\t\t\t\tfundamental difference between poetry - especially Arabic\n\t\t\t\tpoetry - and divine revelation as exemplified by the\n\t\t\t\tQur\u0027an: whereas in the former the meaning is often\n\t\t\t\tsubordinated to the rhythm and the melody of language, in\n\t\t\t\tthe Qur\u0027an the exact opposite is the case, inasmuch as\n\t\t\t\there the choice of words, their sound and their position\n\t\t\t\tin the sentence - and, hence, its rhythm and melody - are\n\t\t\t\talways subordinated to the meaning intended.

This historical reference does not,\n\t\t\t\thowever, provide a full explanation of the above passage.\n\t\t\t\tIn accordance with the Qur\u0027anic method, allusions to\n\t\t\t\thistorical events - whether relating to contemporary\n\t\t\t\toccurrences or to earlier times - are always made with a\n\t\t\t\tview to expressing ethical teachings of a permanent\n\t\t\t\tnature; and the passage under consideration is no\n\t\t\t\texception in this respect. As the wording shows, it\n\t\t\t\trelates not to \"lowly\" followers of Islam but to people\n\t\t\t\twho, while not being Muslims in the current sense of this\n\t\t\t\tword, believe in God and are always (\"at morn and\n\t\t\t\tevening\") \"seeking His countenance\" (i.e., His grace and\n\t\t\t\tacceptance): and thus, verses {52-53} connect logically\n\t\t\t\twith verse {51}. Although primarily addressed to the\n\t\t\t\tProphet, the exhortation voiced in this passage is\n\t\t\t\tdirected to all followers of the Qur\u0027an: they are\n\t\t\t\tenjoined not to repulse anyone who believes in God - even\n\t\t\t\tthough his beliefs may not fully answer to the demands of\n\t\t\t\tthe Qur\u0027an - but, on the contrary, to try to help him by\n\t\t\t\tmeans of a patient explanation of the Qur\u0027anic teachings."

Most of the great\n\t\t\t\tIslamic jurists are of the opinion that whereas\n\t\t\t\tfour-fifths of all spoils may either be distributed among\n\t\t\t\tthose who actively took part in the war effort or may be\n\t\t\t\totherwise utilized for the welfare of the community,\n\t\t\t\tone-fifth must be reserved for the specific purposes\n\t\t\t\tenumerated in the above verse, including a share \"for God\n\t\t\t\tand the Apostle\" (which is obviously a metonym for a\n\t\t\t\tgovernment that rules in accordance with the laws of the\n\t\t\t\tQur\u0027an and the teachings of God\u0027s Apostle); this latter\n\t\t\t\tshare is to be used for the exigencies of state\n\t\t\t\tadministration.

The term \"apostle\" is obviously used here in\n\t\t\t\tits generic sense and applies to all the prophets on\n\t\t\t\twhose teachings the beliefs of the Jews and the\n\t\t\t\tChristians are supposed to be based - in particular, to\n\t\t\t\tMoses and (in the case of the Christians) to Jesus as\n\t\t\t\twell (Manar X, 333 and 337). Since, earlier in this\n\t\t\t\tsentence, the people alluded to are accused of so grave a\n\t\t\t\tsin as wilfully refusing to believe in God and the Last\n\t\t\t\tDay (i.e., in life after death and man\u0027s individual\n\t\t\t\tresponsibility for his doings on earth), it is\n\t\t\t\tinconceivable that they should subsequently be blamed for\n\t\t\t\tcomparatively minor offences against their religious law:\n\t\t\t\tconsequently, the stress on their \"not forbidding that\n\t\t\t\twhich God and His apostle have forbidden\" must refer to\n\t\t\t\tsomething which is as grave, or almost as grave, as\n\t\t\t\tdisbelief in God. In the context of an ordinance\n\t\t\t\tenjoining war against them, this \"something\" can mean\n\t\t\t\tonly one thing - namely, unprovoked aggression: for it is\n\t\t\t\tthis that has been forbidden by God through all the\n\t\t\t\tapostles who were entrusted with conveying His message to\n\t\t\t\tman. Thus, the above verse must be understood as a call\n\t\t\t\tto the believers to fight against such - and only such -\n\t\t\t\tof the nominal followers of earlier revelation as deny\n\t\t\t\ttheir own professed beliefs by committing aggression\n\t\t\t\tagainst the followers of the Qur\u0027an (cf.

It is,\n\t\t\t\thowever, most probable - and the evidence provided by the\n\t\t\t\trecently discovered Dead Sea Scrolls strongly supports\n\t\t\t\tthis view - that the term hawari was popularly used to\n\t\t\t\tdenote a member of the Essene Brotherhood, a Jewish\n\t\t\t\treligious group which existed in Palestine at the time of\n\t\t\t\tJesus, and to which, possibly, he himself belonged.

Several years before Muhammad\u0027s call to\n\t\t\t\tprophethood, his wife Khadijah made him a present of a\n\t\t\t\tyoung slave, Zayd ibn Harithah, a descendant of the\n\t\t\t\tNorth-Arabian tribe of Banu Kalb, who had been taken\n\t\t\t\tcaptive as a child in the course of one of the many\n\t\t\t\ttribal wars and then sold into slavery at Mecca. As soon\n\t\t\t\tas he became the boy\u0027s owner, Muhammad freed him, and\n\t\t\t\tshortly afterwards adopted him as his son; and Zayd, in\n\t\t\t\this turn, was among the first to embrace Islam. Years\n\t\t\t\tlater, impelled by the desire to break down the ancient\n\t\t\t\tArabian prejudice against a slave\u0027s or even a freedman\u0027s\n\t\t\t\tmarrying a \"free-born\" woman, the Prophet persuaded Zayd\n\t\t\t\tto marry his (Muhammad\u0027s) own cousin, Zaynab bint Jahsh,\n\t\t\t\twho, without his being aware of it, had been in love with\n\t\t\t\tMuhammad ever since her childhood. Hence, she consented\n\t\t\t\tto the proposed marriage with great reluctance, and only\n\t\t\t\tin deference to the authority of the Prophet. Since Zayd,\n\t\t\t\ttoo, was not at all keen on this alliance (being already\n\t\t\t\thappily married to another freed slave, Umm Ayman, the\n\t\t\t\tmother of his son Usamah), it was not surprising that the\n\t\t\t\tmarriage did not bring happiness to either Zaynab or\n\t\t\t\tZayd. On several occasions the latter was about to\n\t\t\t\tdivorce his new wife who, on her part, did not make any\n\t\t\t\tsecret of her dislike of Zayd; and each time they were\n\t\t\t\tpersuaded by the Prophet to persevere in patience and not\n\t\t\t\tto separate. In the end, however, the marriage proved\n\t\t\t\tuntenable, and Zayd divorced Zaynab in the year 5 H.\n\t\t\t\tShortly afterwards the Prophet married her in order to\n\t\t\t\tredeem what he considered to be his moral responsibility\n\t\t\t\tfor her past unhappiness."

(Cf. in this respect\n\t\t\t\tnote [26] above, where the meaning of sa\u0027ah - lit.,\n\t\t\t\t\"hour\" - is explained.)"

        "NoteID":  43,
        "Body":  "Sc., \"and having become incorporated in the Islamic\n\t\t\t\tstate\". The term jizyah, rendered by me as \"exemption\n\t\t\t\ttax\", occurs in the Qur\u0027an only once, but its meaning and\n\t\t\t\tpurpose have been fully explained in many authentic\n\t\t\t\tTraditions. It is intimately bound up with the concept of\n\t\t\t\tthe Islamic state as an ideological organization: and\n\t\t\t\tthis is a point which must always be borne in mind if the\n\t\t\t\treal purport of this tax is to be understood. In the\n\t\t\t\tIslamic state, every able-bodied Muslim is obliged to\n\t\t\t\ttake up arms in jihad (i.e., in a just war in God\u0027s\n\t\t\t\tcause) whenever the freedom of his faith or the political\n\t\t\t\tsafety of his community is imperilled: in other words,\n\t\t\t\tevery able-bodied Muslim is liable to compulsory military\n\t\t\t\tservice. Since this is, primarily, a religious obligation\n\t\t\t\tnon-Muslim citizens, who do not subscribe to the ideology\n\t\t\t\tof Islam, cannot in fairness be expected to assume a\n\t\t\t\tsimilar burden. On the other hand, they must be accorded\n\t\t\t\tfull protection of all their civic rights and of their\n\t\t\t\treligious freedom: and it is in order to compensate the\n\t\t\t\tMuslim community for this unequal distribution of civic\n\t\t\t\tburdens that a special tax is levied on non-Muslim\n\t\t\t\tcitizens (ahl adh-dhimmah, lit., \"covenanted\" [or\n\t\t\t\t\"protected\"] people\", i.e., non-Muslims whose safety is\n\t\t\t\tstatutorily assured by the Muslim community). Thus,\n\t\t\t\tjizyah is no more and no less than an exemption tax in\n\t\t\t\tlieu of military service and in compensation for the\n\t\t\t\t\"covenant of protection\" (dhimmah) accorded to such\n\t\t\t\tcitizens by the Islamic state. (The term itself is\n\t\t\t\tderived from the verb jaza \"he rendered [something] as a\n\t\t\t\tsatisfaction\", or \"as a compensation [in lieu of\n\t\t\t\tsomething else;\" - cf. Lane II, 422.) No fixed rate has\n\t\t\t\tbeen set either by the Qur\u0027an or by the Prophet for this\n\t\t\t\ttax; but from all available Traditions it is evident that\n\t\t\t\tit is to be considerably lower than the tax called zakah\n\t\t\t\t(\"the purifying dues\") to which Muslims are liable and\n\t\t\t\twhich - because it is a specifically Islamic religious\n\t\t\t\tduty - is naturally not to be levied on non-Muslims. Only\n\t\t\t\tsuch of the non-Muslim citizens who, if they were\n\t\t\t\tMuslims, would be expected to serve in the armed forces\n\t\t\t\tof the state are liable to the payment of jizyah,\n\t\t\t\tprovided that they can easily afford it. Accordingly, all\n\t\t\t\tnon-Muslim citizens whose personal status or condition\n\t\t\t\twould automatically free them from the obligation to\n\t\t\t\trender military service are statutorily - that is, on the\n\t\t\t\tbasis of clear-cut ordinances promulgated by the Prophet\n\t\t\t\t- exempted from the payment of jizyah: (a) all women, (b)\n\t\t\t\tmales who have not yet reached full maturity, (c) old\n\t\t\t\tmen, (d) all sick or crippled men, (e) priests and monks.\n\t\t\t\tAll non-Muslim citizens who volunteer for military\n\t\t\t\tservice are obviously exempted from the payment of\n\t\t\t\tjizyah. My rendering of the expression \u0027an yad (lit.,\n\t\t\t\t\"out of hand\") as \"with a willing hand\", that is, without\n\t\t\t\treluctance, is based on one of several explanations\n\t\t\t\toffered by Zamakhshari in his commentary on the above\n\t\t\t\tverse. Rashid Rida\u0027, taking the word yad in its\n\t\t\t\tmetaphorical significance of \"power\" or \"ability\",\n\t\t\t\trelates the phrase \u0027an yad to the financial ability of\n\t\t\t\tthe person liable to the payment of jizyah (see Manar X,\n\t\t\t\t342): an interpretation which is undoubtedly justified in\n\t\t\t\tview of the accepted definition of this tax."

As regards the belief attributed to the Jews\n\t\t\t\tthat Ezra (or, in the Arabicized form of this name\n\t\t\t\t\u0027Uzayr) was \"God\u0027s son\", it is to be noted that almost\n\t\t\t\tall classical commentators of the Our\u0027an agree in that\n\t\t\t\tonly the Jews of Arabia, and not all Jews, have been thus\n\t\t\t\taccused. (According to a Tradition on the authority of\n\t\t\t\tIbn \u0027Abbas - quoted by Tabari in his commentary on this\n\t\t\t\tverse - some of the Jews of Medina once said to Muhammad,\n\t\t\t\t\"How could we follow thee when thou hast forsaken our\n\t\t\t\tqiblah and dost not consider Ezra a son of God?\") On the\n\t\t\t\tother hand, Ezra occupies a unique position in the esteem\n\t\t\t\tof all Jews, and has always been praised by them in the\n\t\t\t\tmost extravagant terms. It was he who restored and\n\t\t\t\tcodified the Torah after it had been lost during the\n\t\t\t\tBabylonian Exile, and \"edited\" it in more or less the\n\t\t\t\tform which it has today, and thus \"he promoted the\n\t\t\t\testablishment of an exclusive, legalistic type of\n\t\t\t\treligion that became dominant in later Judaism\"\n\t\t\t\t(Encyclopaedia Britannica, 1963, vol. IX, p. 15). Ever\n\t\t\t\tsince then he has been venerated to such a degree that\n\t\t\t\this verdicts on the Law of Moses have come to be regarded\n\t\t\t\tby the Talmudists as being practically equivalent to the\n\t\t\t\tLaw itself: which, in Qur\u0027anic ideology, amounts to the\n\t\t\t\tunforgivable sin of shirk, inasmuch as it implies the\n\t\t\t\televation of a human being to the status of a\n\t\t\t\tquasi-divine law-giver and the blasphemous attribution to\n\t\t\t\thim - albeit metaphorically - of the quality of \"sonship\"\n\t\t\t\tin relation to God. Cf. in this connection Exodus iv,\n\t\t\t\t22-23 (\"Israel is My son\") or Jeremiah xxxi, 9 (\"I am a\n\t\t\t\tfather to Israel\"): expressions to which, because of\n\t\t\t\ttheir idolatrous implications, the Qur\u0027an takes strong\n\t\t\t\texception."

As to the operative verb yatawaffa, it\n\t\t\t\tprimarily denotes \"He takes [something] away in full\";\n\t\t\t\tand because death is characterized by a disappearance of\n\t\t\t\tall vital impulses (the \"soul\") from the once-living body\n\t\t\t\t- their being \"taken away in full\", as it were - this\n\t\t\t\tform of the verb has been used tropically, since time\n\t\t\t\timmemorial, in the sense of \"causing to die\", and (in its\n\t\t\t\tintransitive form) \"dying\" or (as a noun) \"death\": a\n\t\t\t\tusage invariably adhered to in the Qur\u0027an. The\n\t\t\t\ttraditional likening of sleep to death is due to the fact\n\t\t\t\tthat in both cases the body appears to be devoid of\n\t\t\t\tconsciousness, partially and temporarily in the former\n\t\t\t\tcase, and completely and permanently in the latter. (The\n\t\t\t\tpopular translation of anfus-pl. of nafs - as \"souls\" is\n\t\t\t\tcertainly inappropriate in the above context, since,\n\t\t\t\taccording to the fundamental teaching of the Qur\u0027an,\n\t\t\t\tman\u0027s soul does not \"die\" at the time of his bodily death\n\t\t\t\tbut, on the contrary, lives on indefinitely. Hence, the\n\t\t\t\tterm anfus must be rendered here as \"human beings\".)"

With all this, he stipulated in his\n\t\t\t\tsermon on the occasion of the Farewell Pilgrimage,\n\t\t\t\tshortly before his death, that beating should be resorted\n\t\t\t\tto only if the wife \"has become guilty, in an obvious\n\t\t\t\tmanner, of immoral conduct\", and that it should be done\n\t\t\t\t\"in such a way as not to cause pain (ghayr mubarrih)\";\n\t\t\t\tauthentic Traditions to this effect are found in Muslim,\n\t\t\t\tTirmidhi, Abu Da\u0027ad, Nasa\u0027i and Ibn Majah.

According to this interpretation,\n\t\t\t\tthe above sentence would have the following meaning: \"...\n\t\t\t\tso that the denial of the truth on the part of him who\n\t\t\t\thas denied it, and the faith of him who has attained to\n\t\t\t\tit, might become clearly evident\" Zamakhshari); or \"let\n\t\t\t\thim who is bent on denying the truth go on denying it\n\t\t\t\tafter this clear evidence of God\u0027s will, and let him who\n\t\t\t\thas attained to belief go on believing\" (Ibn Ishaq, as\n\t\t\t\tquoted by Ibn Kathir). In my opinion, however, it is\n\t\t\t\tpreferable to interpret the references to death and life\n\t\t\t\tin their prima-facie (that is, not metaphorical) sense -\n\t\t\t\tnamely, as applying to the death or survival of all who\n\t\t\t\ttook part in the battle of Badr, believers and\n\t\t\t\tunbelievers alike: the believers who fell in that battle\n\t\t\t\tdied conscious of being martyrs in God\u0027s cause, and those\n\t\t\t\twho survived could now clearly discern God\u0027s hand in\n\t\t\t\ttheir victory; while the dead among the deniers of the\n\t\t\t\ttruth had clearly given their lives for nothing, and\n\t\t\t\tthose of them who survived must now realize that their\n\t\t\t\tcrushing defeat was due, in the last resort, to something\n\t\t\t\tinfinitely greater than the valour of the Muslims (cf.\n\t\t\t\tverse {17}, and the corresponding notes)."

As is evident from the sequence, the above\n\t\t\t\tpassage is part of an argument against the Christian\n\t\t\t\tdoctrine of the divinity of Jesus.

It is this very statement which induced the\n\t\t\t\topponents of Muhammad - in his own time as well as in\n\t\t\t\tlater times - to question the authenticity of the Qur\u0027an:\n\t\t\t\t\"If it had really been revealed by God,\" they argue,\n\t\t\t\t\"would so many of its propositions, especially its social\n\t\t\t\tlaws, differ so radically from the laws promulgated in\n\t\t\t\tthat earlier divine writ, the Torah?\" By advancing this\n\t\t\t\targument (and quite apart from the question of whether\n\t\t\t\tthe text of the Bible as we know it today has or has not\n\t\t\t\tbeen corrupted in the course of time), the opponents of\n\t\t\t\tMuhammad\u0027s message deliberately overlook the fact,\n\t\t\t\trepeatedly stressed in the Qur\u0027an, that the earlier\n\t\t\t\tsystems of law were conditioned by the spiritual level of\n\t\t\t\ta particular people and the exigencies of a particular\n\t\t\t\tchapter of human history, and therefore had to be\n\t\t\t\tsuperseded by new laws at a higher stage of human\n\t\t\t\tdevelopment (see in this connection the second paragraph\n\t\t\t\tof \u003ca href=\u0027qa:5.48\u0027\u003e5:48\u003c/a\u003e and the corresponding note [66]). However, as\n\t\t\t\tis evident from the immediate sequence - and especially\n\t\t\t\tfrom the last sentence of this verse - the above specious\n\t\t\t\targument is not meant to uphold the authenticity of the\n\t\t\t\tBible as against that of the Qur\u0027an, but, rather, aims at\n\t\t\t\tdiscrediting both - and through them, the basic religious\n\t\t\t\tpriciple against which the irreligious mind always\n\t\t\t\trevolts: namely, the idea of divine revelation and of\n\t\t\t\tman\u0027s absolute dependence on and responsibilty to God,\n\t\t\t\tthe Ultimate Cause of all that exists."

        "Body":  "The term \u0027arsh (lit., \"throne\" or, more properly, \"seat\n\t\t\t\tof power\") is used in the Qur\u0027an to denote God\u0027s absolute\n\t\t\t\tsway over all that exists; hence, the expression dhu\n\t\t\t\t\u0027l-\u0027arsh may be suitably rendered as \"He who is enthroned\n\t\t\t\tin His almightiness\". Beyond this, the commentators are\n\t\t\t\tnot entirely agreed as to the purport of the above\n\t\t\t\tsentence. Some take it to mean that \"had there been other\n\t\t\t\tdeities apart from God, they would endeavour to deprive\n\t\t\t\tHim of some or all of His power, and would thus create\n\t\t\t\tchaos in the universe\". Others - and most prominently\n\t\t\t\tamong them Tabarl and Ibn Kathlr - have a far better,\n\t\t\t\tthough somewhat more complicated explanation to offer.\n\t\t\t\tStarting from the legitimate assumption that those who\n\t\t\t\tbelieve in the existence of other deities or divine\n\t\t\t\tpowers apart from God regard them as no more than\n\t\t\t\tmediators between man and Him, the argument runs thus: If\n\t\t\t\tthose alleged divine or semi-divine \"mediators\" would\n\t\t\t\treally exist, then it is obvious that, being no more than\n\t\t\t\tmediators, even they would have to recognize Him as the\n\t\t\t\tSupreme Being - which would amount to admitting that they\n\t\t\t\thave no power of their own but are, in the last resort,\n\t\t\t\tentirely dependent on and subject to Him: and this\n\t\t\t\tunavoidable conclusion implies a negation of any divinity\n\t\t\t\tin those imaginary \"mediators\". This being so, is it not\n\t\t\t\tfar more reasonable for man to turn directly to God, who\n\t\t\t\tis almighty, all-seeing, all-hearing, and has therefore\n\t\t\t\tno need of any mediator?"

In the above context it alludes\n\t\t\t\tto the impossibility of defining God even by means of a\n\t\t\t\tmetaphor or a parable - for, since \"there is nothing like\n\t\t\t\tunto Him\" (\u003ca href=\u0027qa:42.11\u0027\u003e42:11\u003c/a\u003e), there is also \"nothing that could be\n\t\t\t\tcompared with Him\" (\u003ca href=\u0027qa:112.4\u0027\u003e112:4\u003c/a\u003e).

        "Body":  "The reference to prayer at this place arises from the\n\t\t\t\tmention, in the preceding verses, of the Day of Judgment,\n\t\t\t\twhen man will have to answer before God for what he did\n\t\t\t\tduring his life in this world: for it is in prayer that\n\t\t\t\tman faces God, spiritually, during his earthly life, and\n\t\t\t\treminds himself of his responsibility towards the\n\t\t\t\tCreator. As regards the prohibition of attempting to pray\n\t\t\t\t\"while in a state of drunkenness\", some of the\n\t\t\t\tcommentators assume that this ordinance represented the\n\t\t\t\tfirst stage of the total prohibition of intoxicants, and\n\t\t\t\thas been, consequently, \"abrogated\" by the promulgation\n\t\t\t\tof the law of total abstinence from all intoxicants\n\t\t\t\t(\u003ca href=\u0027qa:5.90\u0027\u003e5:90\u003c/a\u003e). However, quite apart from the fact that the\n\t\t\t\tdoctrine of \"abrogation\" is entirely untenable (see surah\n\t\t\t\t{2}, note [87]), there is no warrant whatever for\n\t\t\t\tregarding the above verse as a \"first step\" which has\n\t\t\t\tbecome redundant, as it were, after total prohibition was\n\t\t\t\tordained. It is, of course, true that the Qur\u0027an forbids\n\t\t\t\tthe use of intoxicants at all times, and not merely at\n\t\t\t\tthe time of prayer; but since \"man has been created weak\"\n\t\t\t\t(\u003ca href=\u0027qa:4.28\u0027\u003e4:28\u003c/a\u003e), his lapse from the way of virtue is always a\n\t\t\t\tpossibility: and it is to prevent him from adding the sin\n\t\t\t\tof praying while in a state of drunkenness to the sin of\n\t\t\t\tusing intoxicants as such that the above verse was\n\t\t\t\tpromulgated. Moreover, the expression \"while you are in a\n\t\t\t\tstate of drunkenness (sukara)\" does not apply exclusively\n\t\t\t\tto alcoholic intoxication, since the term sukr, in its\n\t\t\t\twider connotation, signifies any state of mental\n\t\t\t\tdisequilibrium which prevents man from making full use of\n\t\t\t\this intellectual faculties: that is to say, it can apply\n\t\t\t\talso to a temporary clouding of the intellect by drugs or\n\t\t\t\tgiddiness or passion, as well as to the state\n\t\t\t\tmetaphorically described as \"drunk with sleep\" - in\n\t\t\t\tbrief, to any condition in which normal judgment is\n\t\t\t\tconfused or suspended. And because the Qur\u0027an insists\n\t\t\t\tthroughout on consciousness as an indispensable element\n\t\t\t\tin every act of worship, prayer is permitted only when\n\t\t\t\tman is in full possession of his mental faculties and\n\t\t\t\t\"knows what he is saying\"."

        "Body":  "I.e., their obstinate desire to obtain closer and closer\n\t\t\t\tdefinitions of the simple commandment revealed to them\n\t\t\t\tthrough Moses had made it almost impossible for them to\n\t\t\t\tfulfil it. In his commentary on this passage, Tabari\n\t\t\t\tquotes the following remark of Ibn \u0027Abbas: \"If [in the\n\t\t\t\tfirst instance] they had sacrificed any cow chosen by\n\t\t\t\tthemselves, they would have fulfilled their duty; but\n\t\t\t\tthey made it complicated for themselves, and so God made\n\t\t\t\tit complicated for them.\" A similar view has been\n\t\t\t\texpressed, in the same context, by Zamakhshari. It would\n\t\t\t\tappear that the moral of this story points to an\n\t\t\t\timportant problem of all (and, therefore, also of\n\t\t\t\tIslamic) religious jurisprudence: namely, the\n\t\t\t\tinadvisability of trying to elicit additional details in\n\t\t\t\trespect of any religious law that had originally been\n\t\t\t\tgiven in general terms - for, the more numerous and\n\t\t\t\tmultiform such details become, the more complicated and\n\t\t\t\trigid becomes the law. This point has been acutely\n\t\t\t\tgrasped by Rashid Rida\u0027, who says in his commentary on\n\t\t\t\tthe above Qur\u0027anic passage (see Manar I, 345 f.): \"Its\n\t\t\t\tlesson is that one should not pursue one\u0027s [legal]\n\t\t\t\tinquiries in such a way as to make laws more\n\t\t\t\tcomplicated.... This was how the early generations [of\n\t\t\t\tMuslims] visualized the problem. They did not make things\n\t\t\t\tcomplicated for themselves - and so, for them, the\n\t\t\t\treligious law (din) was natural, simple and liberal in\n\t\t\t\tits straightforwardness. But those who came later added\n\t\t\t\tto it [certain other] injunctions which they had deduced\n\t\t\t\tby means of their own reasoning (ijtihad); and they\n\t\t\t\tmultiplied those [additional] injunctions to such an\n\t\t\t\textent that the religious law became a heavy burden on\n\t\t\t\tthe community.\" For the sociological reason why the\n\t\t\t\tgenuine ordinances of Islamic Law - that is, those which\n\t\t\t\thave been prima facie laid down as such in the Qur\u0027an and\n\t\t\t\tthe teachings of the Prophet - are almost always devoid\n\t\t\t\tof details, I would refer the reader to my book State and\n\t\t\t\tGovernment in Islam (pp. 11 ff. and passim). The\n\t\t\t\timportance of this problem, illustrated in the above\n\t\t\t\tstory of the cow - and correctly grasped by the Prophet\u0027s\n\t\t\t\tCompanions - explains why this surah has been entitled\n\t\t\t\t\"The Cow\".

Neither the Qur\u0027an, nor any\n\t\t\t\tsaying of the Prophet, nor even the Bible offers the\n\t\t\t\tslightest warrant for this highly imaginative\n\t\t\t\texplanation, which must, therefore, be rejected - quite\n\t\t\t\tapart from the fact that the pronoun hu in idribuhu has a\n\t\t\t\tmasculine gender, while the noun nafs (here translated as\n\t\t\t\t\"human being\") is feminine in gender: from which it\n\t\t\t\tfollows that the imperative idribuhu cannot possibly\n\t\t\t\trefer to nafs. On the other hand, the verb daraba (lit.,\n\t\t\t\t\"he struck\") is very often used in a figurative or\n\t\t\t\tmetonymic sense, as, for instance, in the expression\n\t\t\t\tdaraba fi \u0027l-ard (\"he journeyed on earth\"), or daraba\n\t\t\t\t\u0027sh-shay\u0027 bi\u0027sh-shay\u0027 (\"he mixed one thing with another\n\t\t\t\tthing\"), or daraba mathal (\"he coined a similitude\" or\n\t\t\t\t\"propounded a parable\" or \"gave an illustration\"), or\n\t\t\t\t\u0027ala darb wahid (\"similarly applied\" or \"in the same\n\t\t\t\tmanner\"), or duribat \u0027alayhim adh-dhillah (\"humiliation\n\t\t\t\twas imposed on them\" or \"applied to them\"), and so forth.\n\t\t\t\tTaking all this into account, I am of the opinion that\n\t\t\t\tthe imperative idribuhu occurring in the above Qur\u0027anic\n\t\t\t\tpassage must be translated as \"apply it\" or \"this\"\n\t\t\t\t(referring, in this context, to the principle of communal\n\t\t\t\tresponsibility). As for the feminine pronoun ha in\n\t\t\t\tba\u0027diha (\"some of it\"), it must necessarily relate to the\n\t\t\t\tnearest preceding feminine noun - that is, to the nafs\n\t\t\t\tthat has been murdered, or the act of murder itself about\n\t\t\t\twhich (fiha) the community disagreed. Thus, the phrase\n\t\t\t\tidribuhu bi-ba\u0027diha may be suitably rendered as \"apply\n\t\t\t\tthis [principle] to some of those [cases of unresolved\n\t\t\t\tmurder]\": for it is obvious that the principle of\n\t\t\t\tcommunal responsibility for murder by a person or persons\n\t\t\t\tunknown can be applied only to some and not to all such\n\t\t\t\tcases."

The immediate reason for this\n\t\t\t\texpedition was the information which the Prophet received\n\t\t\t\tto the effect that the Byzantines, made apprehensive by\n\t\t\t\tthe rapid growth of Islam in Arabia and incited by the\n\t\t\t\tProphet\u0027s enemy Abu \u0027Amir (see note [142] on verse {107}\n\t\t\t\tof this surah), were assembling large forces on the\n\t\t\t\tconfines of the Peninsula with a view to marching against\n\t\t\t\tMedina and overthrowing the Muslims. To guard against\n\t\t\t\tsuch an assault, the prophet assembled the strongest\n\t\t\t\tforce the Muslims were capable of, and set out in the\n\t\t\t\tmonth of Rajab, 9 H., towards the frontier. On reaching\n\t\t\t\tTabak, about half-way between Medina and Damascus, the\n\t\t\t\tProphet ascertained that the Byzantines were either not\n\t\t\t\tyet ready to invade Arabia or had entirely given up the\n\t\t\t\tidea for the time being; and so - in accordance with the\n\t\t\t\tIslamic principle that war may be waged only in\n\t\t\t\tself-defence - he returned with his followers to Medina\n\t\t\t\twithout engaging in hostilities. At the time of the\n\t\t\t\tpreparation for this expedition, the hypocrites and a\n\t\t\t\tminority among the believers displayed an extreme\n\t\t\t\treluctance (referred to in this and the following verses)\n\t\t\t\tto embark on a war with Byzantium: and it is this\n\t\t\t\tminority that the above verse reproaches for \"clinging\n\t\t\t\theavily to the earth\" (Manar X 493)."

In\n\t\t\t\tsuch a social order, material success and power are\n\t\t\t\tusually seen as consequences of a more or less conscious\n\t\t\t\trejection of all metaphysical considerations - and, in\n\t\t\t\tparticular, of all that is comprised in the concept of\n\t\t\t\tGod-willed standards of morality - on the assumption that\n\t\t\t\tthey are but an obstacle in the path of man\u0027s free,\n\t\t\t\tunlimited \"development\". It goes without saying that this\n\t\t\t\tattitude (which has reached its epitome in the modern\n\t\t\t\tstatement that \"religion is opium for the people\") is\n\t\t\t\tdiametrically opposed to the demand, voiced by every\n\t\t\t\thigher religion, that man\u0027s social life, if it is to be a\n\t\t\t\ttruly \"good\" life, must be subordinated to definite\n\t\t\t\tethical principles and restraints. By their very nature,\n\t\t\t\tthese restraints inhibit the unprincipled power-drive\n\t\t\t\twhich dominates the more materialistic societies and\n\t\t\t\tenables them to achieve - without regard to the damage\n\t\t\t\tdone to others and, spiritually, to themselves - outward\n\t\t\t\tcomforts and positions of strength in the shortest\n\t\t\t\tpossible time: but precisely because they do act as a\n\t\t\t\tbrake on man\u0027s selfishness and power-hunger, it is these\n\t\t\t\tmoral considerations and restraints - and they alone -\n\t\t\t\tthat can free a community from the interminable,\n\t\t\t\tself-destructive inner tensions and frustrations to which\n\t\t\t\tmaterialistic societies are subject, and thus bring about\n\t\t\t\ta more enduring, because more organic, state of social\n\t\t\t\twell-being. This, in short, is the elliptically implied\n\t\t\t\tanswer of the Qur\u0027an to a rhetorical question placed in\n\t\t\t\tthe mouths of \"those who are bent on denying the truth\"."

However, since the next two verses clearly\n\t\t\t\trelate to Jesus and to the false beliefs of the\n\t\t\t\tChristians regarding his nature and mission, we must\n\t\t\t\tconclude that both Jews and Christians are referred to in\n\t\t\t\tthis passage. For this reason, the term al-kitab, which\n\t\t\t\toccurs three times in this sentence, has been rendered\n\t\t\t\there as \"the Bible\". - According to Muhammad \u0027Abduh\n\t\t\t\t(Manar III, 345), the above-mentioned distortion of the\n\t\t\t\tBible does not necessarily presuppose a corruption of the\n\t\t\t\ttext as such: it can also be brought about \"by\n\t\t\t\tattributing to an expression a meaning other than the one\n\t\t\t\twhich was originally intended\".

Subsequently, however, some of those who claimed\n\t\t\t\tto be followers of Jesus lifted this expression from the\n\t\t\t\trealm of metaphor and \"transferred it to the realm of\n\t\t\t\tpositive reality with reference to Jesus alone\": and thus\n\t\t\t\tthey gave currency to the idea that he was literally \"the\n\t\t\t\tson of God\", that is, God incarnate."

The verb fara - which\n\t\t\t\tliterally means \"it boiled over\" - describes the raging\n\t\t\t\ttorrents of water which \"turned the earth into springs\"\n\t\t\t\t(Ibn Kathir; see also \u003ca href=\u0027qa:54.12\u0027\u003e54:12\u003c/a\u003e). This \"gushing forth of\n\t\t\t\twater over the face of the earth\" seems to point to the\n\t\t\t\tinundation of the huge valley now covered by the\n\t\t\t\tMediterranean Sea (see surah {7}, note [47]) - an\n\t\t\t\tinundation which, augmented by continuous, torrential\n\t\t\t\trains (cf. \u003ca href=\u0027qa:54.11\u0027\u003e54:11\u003c/a\u003e), rapidly spread over the land-mass of\n\t\t\t\tpresent-day Syria and northern \u0027Iraq and grew into the\n\t\t\t\timmense deluge described in the Bible and in the Qur\u0027an,\n\t\t\t\tand also referred to in the myths of ancient Greece\n\t\t\t\t(e.g., in the story of Deukalion and Pyrrhea), as well as\n\t\t\t\tin Sumerian and Babylonian legends."

Some of the\n\t\t\t\tearliest, most outstanding authorities on the Qur\u0027an,\n\t\t\t\tlike Ibn \u0027Abbas, Mujahid, Ad-Dahhak, Qatadah, Ibn Zayd\n\t\t\t\t(all of them cited by Ibn Kathir), or Al-Hasan al-Basri\n\t\t\t\t(quoted by Tabari in his commentary on verses {28-29}),\n\t\t\t\tlink this prohibition of further marriages with the\n\t\t\t\tchoice between the charms of worldly life and the good of\n\t\t\t\tthe hereafter with which the wives of the Prophet were\n\t\t\t\tconfronted on the strength of verses {28-29}, and their\n\t\t\t\temphatic option for \"God and His Apostle\" (cf. note [32]\n\t\t\t\tabove). All those early authorities describe the\n\t\t\t\trevelation of verse {52} - and the assurance which it was\n\t\t\t\tmeant to convey to the wives of the Prophet - as God\u0027s\n\t\t\t\treward, in this world, of their faith and fidelity. Since\n\t\t\t\tit is inconceivable that the Prophet could have\n\t\t\t\tdisregarded the categorical injunction, \"No [other] women\n\t\t\t\tshall henceforth be lawful to thee\", the passage in\n\t\t\t\tquestion cannot have been revealed earlier than the year\n\t\t\t\t7 H., that is, the year in which the conquest of Khaybar\n\t\t\t\tand the Prophet\u0027s marriage with Safiyyah - his last\n\t\t\t\tmarriage - took place. Consequently, verses {28-29} (with\n\t\t\t\twhich, as we have seen, verse {52} is closely connected)\n\t\t\t\tmust have been revealed at that later period, and not, as\n\t\t\t\tsome commentators think, in the year 5 H.

(This idea is brought\n\t\t\t\tout fully in the last two verses of this surah.) The\n\t\t\t\tsubsequent parable of Moses and his quest for knowledge\n\t\t\t\t(verses {6-82}) has become, in the course of time, the\n\t\t\t\tnucleus of innumerable legends with which we are not\n\t\t\t\tconcerned here. We have, however, a Tradition on the\n\t\t\t\tauthority of Ubayy ibn Ka\u0027b (recorded in several versions\n\t\t\t\tby Bukhari, Muslim and Tirmidhi), according to which\n\t\t\t\tMoses was rebuked by God for having once asserted that he\n\t\t\t\twas the wisest of all men, and was subsequently told\n\t\t\t\tthrough revelation that a \"servant of God\" who lived at\n\t\t\t\tthe \"junction of the two seas\" was far superior to him in\n\t\t\t\twisdom. When Moses expressed his eagerness to find that\n\t\t\t\tman, God commanded him to \"take a fish in a basket\" and\n\t\t\t\tto go on and on until the fish would disappear: and its\n\t\t\t\tdisappearance was to be a sign that the goal had been\n\t\t\t\treached. - There is no doubt that this Tradition is a\n\t\t\t\tkind of allegorical introduction to our Qur\u0027anic parable.\n\t\t\t\tThe \"fish\" mentioned in the latter as well as in the\n\t\t\t\tabove-mentioned hadith is an ancient religious symbol,\n\t\t\t\tpossibly signifying divine knowledge or life eternal. As\n\t\t\t\tfor the \"junction of the two seas\", which many of the\n\t\t\t\tearly commentators endeavoured to \"identify\" in\n\t\t\t\tgeographical terms (ranging from the meeting of the Red\n\t\t\t\tSea and the Indian Ocean at the Bab al-Mandab to that of\n\t\t\t\tthe Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean at the\n\t\t\t\tStraits of Gibraltar), Baydawi offers, in his commentary\n\t\t\t\ton verse {60}, a purely allegorical explanation: the \"two\n\t\t\t\tseas\" represent the two sources or streams of knowledge -\n\t\t\t\tthe one obtainable through the observation and\n\t\t\t\tintellectual coordination of outward phenomena (\u0027ilm\n\t\t\t\taz-zahir), and the other through intuitive, mystic\n\t\t\t\tinsight (\u0027ilm al-batin) - the meeting of which is the\n\t\t\t\treal goal of Moses\u0027 quest."

        "Body":  "Some of the commentators see in this verse a divine\n\t\t\t\tprediction, thus: \"If there be twenty of you..., they\n\t\t\t\tshall overcome two hundred...\", etc. Since, however,\n\t\t\t\thistory shows that the believers, even at the time of the\n\t\t\t\tProphet, were not always victorious against such odds,\n\t\t\t\tthe above view is not tenable. In order to understand\n\t\t\t\tthis passage correctly, we must read it in close\n\t\t\t\tconjunction with the opening sentence, \"Inspire the\n\t\t\t\tbelievers to conquer all fear of death\", whereupon we\n\t\t\t\tarrive at the meaning given in my rendering: namely, an\n\t\t\t\texhortation to the believers to conquer all fear of death\n\t\t\t\tand to be so patient in adversity that they might be able\n\t\t\t\tto overcome an enemy many times their number (Razi; see\n\t\t\t\talso Manar X, 87). The concluding words of this verse -\n\t\t\t\t\"because they are people who cannot grasp it [i.e., the\n\t\t\t\ttruth]\" - can be understood in either of two ways: (a) as\n\t\t\t\tgiving an additional reason of the true believers\u0027\n\t\t\t\tsuperiority over \"those who are bent on denying the\n\t\t\t\ttruth\" (alladhina kafaru), inasmuch as the latter, not\n\t\t\t\tbelieving in the eternal verities and in life after\n\t\t\t\tdeath, cannot rise to that enthusiasm and readiness for\n\t\t\t\tself-sacrifice which distinguishes the true believers; or\n\t\t\t\t(b) as explaining that \"those who are bent on denying the\n\t\t\t\ttruth\" deny it simply because their spiritual deafness\n\t\t\t\tand blindness prevents them from grasping it. To my mind,\n\t\t\t\tthe second of these two interpretations is preferable,\n\t\t\t\tand particularly so in view of the fact that the Qur\u0027an\n\t\t\t\toften explains in these terms the attitude of \"those who\n\t\t\t\tdeny the truth\" (e.g., in \u003ca href=\u0027qa:6.25\u0027\u003e6:25\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\u0027qa:7.179\u0027\u003e7:179\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\u0027qa:9.87\u0027\u003e9:87\u003c/a\u003e, etc.)."

However, the fact that a good many Companions\n\t\t\t\tand their immediate successors (tabi\u0027un) fully agreed on\n\t\t\t\tthe substance of the story, differing only in one or two\n\t\t\t\tinsignificant details\u0027 seems to indicate that at that\n\t\t\t\tperiod it was already well-established in ancient Arabian\n\t\t\t\ttradition (cf. note [77] below). According to this story,\n\t\t\t\ta flock of sheep strayed at night into a neighbouring\n\t\t\t\tfield and destroyed its crop.  The case was brought\n\t\t\t\tbefore King David for judicial decision. On finding that\n\t\t\t\tthe incident was due to the negligence of the owner of\n\t\t\t\tthe sheep, David awarded the whole flock - the value of\n\t\t\t\twhich corresponded roughly to the extent of the damage -\n\t\t\t\tas an indemnity to the owner of the field.  David\u0027s young\n\t\t\t\tson, Solomon, regarded this judgement as too severe,\n\t\t\t\tinasmuch as the sheep represented the defendant\u0027s\n\t\t\t\tcapital, whereas the damage was of a transitory nature,\n\t\t\t\tinvolving no more than the loss of one year\u0027s crop, i.e.,\n\t\t\t\tof income.  He therefore suggested to his father that the\n\t\t\t\tjudgement should be altered: the owner of the field\n\t\t\t\tshould have the temporary possession and usufruct of the\n\t\t\t\tsheep (sheep, wool, new-born lambs, etc.), while their\n\t\t\t\towner should tend the damaged field until it was restored\n\t\t\t\tto its former productivity, whereupon both the field and\n\t\t\t\tthe flock of sheep would revert to their erstwhile\n\t\t\t\towners; in this way the plaintiff would be fully\n\t\t\t\tcompensated for his loss without depriving the defendant\n\t\t\t\tof his substance.  David realized taht his son\u0027d solution\n\t\t\t\tof the case was better than his own, and passed judgement\n\t\t\t\taccordingly; but since he, no less than Solomon, had been\n\t\t\t\tinspired by a deep sense of justice, God - in the words\n\t\t\t\tof the Qur\u0027an - \"bore witness to their judgement\"."

Under those circumstances, the Qur\u0027an says,\n\t\t\t\tthey could not - nor could any Muslim community of later\n\t\t\t\ttimes, in similar circumstances - be expected to bring\n\t\t\t\tforth the effort and the efficiency required of a fully\n\t\t\t\tdeveloped community of believers; but even so they should\n\t\t\t\tbe able to stand up to an enemy twice their number. (The\n\t\t\t\tproportions one to two, or - as in the preceding verse,\n\t\t\t\tone to ten - are not, of course, to be taken literally;\n\t\t\t\tas a matter of fact, the Muslims defeated at Badr a much\n\t\t\t\tbetter armed army more than thrice their own number.) The\n\t\t\t\treference to God\u0027s having \"lightened the burden\" imposed\n\t\t\t\ton the believers in this respect makes it clear that both\n\t\t\t\tthis and the preceding verse imply a divine command\n\t\t\t\tcouched in terms of exhortation, and not a prediction of\n\t\t\t\tevents to come (Razi)."

Since the earlier\n\t\t\t\tprophets invariably appealed to their own community and\n\t\t\t\ttheir own time alone, their teachings were, of necessity,\n\t\t\t\tcircumscribed by the social and intellectual conditions\n\t\t\t\tof that particular community and time; and since the\n\t\t\t\tpeople to whom they addressed themselves had not yet\n\t\t\t\treached the stage of independent thinking, those prophets\n\t\t\t\tstood in need of symbolic portents or miracles (see surah\n\t\t\t\t{6}, note [94]) in order to make the people concerned\n\t\t\t\trealize the inner truth of their mission. The message of\n\t\t\t\tthe Qur\u0027an, on the other hand, was revealed at a time\n\t\t\t\twhen mankind (and, in particular, that part of it which\n\t\t\t\tinhabited the regions marked by the earlier,\n\t\t\t\tJudaeo-Christian religious development) had reached a\n\t\t\t\tdegree of maturity which henceforth enabled it to grasp\n\t\t\t\tan idealogy as such without the aid of those persuasive\n\t\t\t\tportents and miraculous demonstrations which in the past,\n\t\t\t\tas the above verse points out, only too often gave rise\n\t\t\t\tto new, grave misconceptions."

But even with regard to captives taken in\n\t\t\t\twar, the Qur\u0027an ordains (in \u003ca href=\u0027qa:47.4\u0027\u003e47:4\u003c/a\u003e) that they should be\n\t\t\t\tfreed after the war is over."

This extremely plausible explanation\n\t\t\t\tcontrasts sharply with the Biblical account of this\n\t\t\t\tincident (Genesis xliv), according to which the false\n\t\t\t\taccusation was part of an inexplicable \"stratagem\"\n\t\t\t\tdevised by Joseph. If we discard - as we must - this part\n\t\t\t\tof the Biblical version, it is far more logical to assume\n\t\t\t\tthat Joseph who had been granted by the King full\n\t\t\t\tauthority over all that belonged to the latter (see verse\n\t\t\t\t{56} above), had placed the royal cup as a present in the\n\t\t\t\tbag of his favourite brother; and that he did this\n\t\t\t\tsecretly, without informing his servants, because he did\n\t\t\t\tnot want anyone, least of all his ten half-brothers, to\n\t\t\t\tknow his predilection for Benjamin. For a further\n\t\t\t\texplanation of this incident and of its ethical relevance\n\t\t\t\twithin the context of Joseph\u0027s story, see note [77]\n\t\t\t\tbelow."

Although the story of Noah had been\n\t\t\t\tvaguely known to the Arabs even before the advent of the\n\t\t\t\tProphet Muhammad, they - and the Prophet with them - were\n\t\t\t\tentirely unaware of the details as narrated in the\n\t\t\t\tpreceding Qur\u0027anic account (Razi). The use of the plural\n\t\t\t\tat the beginning of this parenthetic passage (\"These\n\t\t\t\taccounts\") - in contrast with the singular form employed\n\t\t\t\tin a similar phrase occurring in \u003ca href=\u0027qa:3.44\u0027\u003e3:44\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\u0027qa:11.100\u0027\u003e11:100\u003c/a\u003e and\n\t\t\t\t\u003ca href=\u0027qa:12.102\u0027\u003e12:102\u003c/a\u003e (\"This account\") - seems, in my opinion, to\n\t\t\t\tindicate that it refers not only to the preceding story\n\t\t\t\tof Noah but also to the subsequent stories of other\n\t\t\t\tprophets. In this connection it should be remembered -\n\t\t\t\tand it cannot be stressed too often - that \"narrative\" as\n\t\t\t\tsuch is never the purpose of the Qur\u0027an. Whenever it\n\t\t\t\trelates the stories of earlier prophets, or alludes to\n\t\t\t\tancient legends or to historical events that took place\n\t\t\t\tbefore the advent of Islam or during the lifetime of the\n\t\t\t\tProphet, the aim is, invariably, a moral lesson; and\n\t\t\t\tsince one and the same event, or even legend, has usually\n\t\t\t\tmany facets revealing as many moral implications, the\n\t\t\t\tQur\u0027an reverts again and again to the same stories, but\n\t\t\t\tevery time with a slight variation of stress on this or\n\t\t\t\tthat aspect of the fundamental truths underlying the\n\t\t\t\tQur\u0027anic revelation as a whole."

In\n\t\t\t\taddition to this, the above verse stresses, by\n\t\t\t\timplication, the positive value of man\u0027s natural,\n\t\t\t\tphysical life-summarized, as it were, in the expression\n\t\t\t\t\"wives and offspring\" - and the rejection of exaggerated\n\t\t\t\tasceticism and self-mortification as an allegedly\n\t\t\t\tdesirable \"way to God\"."

But since this term has occasionally been used\n\t\t\t\tby pre-Islamic Arabs in the sense of \"mail\" or \"coats of\n\t\t\t\tmail\" (ibid.), the classical commentators assume that it\n\t\t\t\thas this meaning in the above context as well; and in\n\t\t\t\tthis they rely on the - otherwise unsupported - statement\n\t\t\t\tof the tabi\u0027i Qatadah to the effect that \"David was the\n\t\t\t\tfirst to make chain mail\" (Tabari). Accordingly, they\n\t\t\t\tunderstand the term ba\u0027s which occurs at the end of the\n\t\t\t\tsentence in its secondary sense of \"war\" or \"warlike\n\t\t\t\tviolence\", and interpret the relevant part of the verse\n\t\t\t\tthus: \"We taught him how to make coats of mail for you,\n\t\t\t\tso that they might fortify you against your [mutual acts\n\t\t\t\tof] violence\", or \"against [the effects of] your warlike\n\t\t\t\tviolence\". One should, however, bear in mind that ba\u0027s\n\t\t\t\tsignifies also \"harm\", \"misfortune\", \"distress\", etc., as\n\t\t\t\twell as \"danger\"; hence it denotes, it its widest sense,\n\t\t\t\tanything that causes distress or fear (Taj al-\u0027Arus). If\n\t\t\t\twe adopt this last meaning, the term labus may be\n\t\t\t\tunderstood in its primary significance of \"garment\" - in\n\t\t\t\tthis case, the metaphorical \"garment of\n\t\t\t\tGod-consciousness\" (libas at-taqwa) of which the Qur\u0027an\n\t\t\t\tspeaks in \u003ca href=\u0027qa:7.26\u0027\u003e7:26\u003c/a\u003e. Rendered in this sense, the above verse\n\t\t\t\texpresses the idea that the Almighty taught David how to\n\t\t\t\timbue his followers with that deep God-consciousness\n\t\t\t\twhich frees men from all spiritual distress and all\n\t\t\t\tfears, whether it be fear of one another or the\n\t\t\t\tsubconscious fear of the Unknown. The concluding\n\t\t\t\trhetorical question, \"but are you grateful [for this\n\t\t\t\tboon]?\" implies that, as a rule, man does not fully\n\t\t\t\trealize - and, hence, is not really grateful for- the\n\t\t\t\tspiritual bounty thus offered him by God."

To my mind, however, this\n\t\t\t\tinterpretation conflicts not only with the immediately\n\t\t\t\tpreceding passages but with the tenor of the Qur\u0027an as a\n\t\t\t\twhole, which insists throughout on man\u0027s responsibility\n\t\t\t\tfor (and, hence, on relative freedom in) choosing between\n\t\t\t\tright and wrong - and this side by side with its stress\n\t\t\t\ton God\u0027s unlimited power to determine the factual course\n\t\t\t\tof events. Hence, I prefer to base my rendering on the\n\t\t\t\tinterpretation advanced and convincingly argued by\n\t\t\t\tTabari, who regards the crucial particle ma not as a\n\t\t\t\tnegation but as a relative pronoun synonymous with\n\t\t\t\talladhi (\"that which\" or \"whatever\"), and understands the\n\t\t\t\tnoun khirah in its primary significance of \"that which is\n\t\t\t\tchosen\" or \"preferred\", i.e., because it is considered to\n\t\t\t\tbe the best: in another word, as a synonym of khayr.\n\t\t\t\tZamakhshari refers to this interpretation with evident\n\t\t\t\tapproval (without, however, mentioning Tabari\n\t\t\t\tspecifically), and enlarges upon it thus: \"God chooses\n\t\t\t\tfor mankind whatever is best (ma hawa khayr) and most\n\t\t\t\tbeneficial (aslah) for them, for He knows better than\n\t\t\t\tthey themselves do what is good for them.\""

Joseph had wanted to keep Benjamin with himself,\n\t\t\t\tbut under the law of Egypt he could not do this without\n\t\t\t\tthe consent of his half-brothers, who were the legal\n\t\t\t\tguardians of their minor brother; and they - bound as\n\t\t\t\tthey were by the solemn promise given to their father -\n\t\t\t\twould certainly not have agreed to Benjamin\u0027s remaining\n\t\t\t\tbehind.

It seems to me,\n\t\t\t\thowever, that this passage goes far beyond the possible\n\t\t\t\thistorical occasion of its revelation, inasmuch as it\n\t\t\t\ttouches upon an often-encountered psychological problem\n\t\t\t\tof faith. People who are not fully convinced that there\n\t\t\t\texists a reality beyond the reach of human perception\n\t\t\t\t(al-ghayb, in the sense explained in surah {2}, note [3])\n\t\t\t\tfind it, as a rule, difficult to dissociate their ethical\n\t\t\t\tviews from their personal predilections and morally\n\t\t\t\tquestionable desires - with the result that they are only\n\t\t\t\ttoo often \"willing to defer to what the powers of evil\n\t\t\t\ttell them\".

Thus, for instance, Razi:\n\t\t\t\t\"Have they [i.e., the deniers of the truth] never yet\n\t\t\t\tseen the turns of fortune (ikhtilafat) that take place in\n\t\t\t\tthis world - destruction after prosperity, death after\n\t\t\t\tlife, humiliation after glory, deficiency after\n\t\t\t\tperfection?...

The placing of one\u0027s dependents on an\n\t\t\t\tequal footing with oneself with regard to the basic\n\t\t\t\tnecessities of life is a categorical demand of Islam;\n\t\t\t\tthus, the Prophet said: \"They are your brethren, these\n\t\t\t\tdependents of yours (khawalukum) whom God has placed\n\t\t\t\tunder your authority [lit., \"under your hand\"].

In the next sentence the Qur\u0027an takes issue\n\t\t\t\twith this attitude and declares, in an equally elliptical\n\t\t\t\tmanner, that all who see in material success an alleged\n\t\t\t\tevidence of God\u0027s approval are blind to spiritual truths\n\t\t\t\tand, therefore, morally powerless and utterly\n\t\t\t\tself-condemned in the sight of God."

The\n\t\t\t\tclassical commentators incline to the first of these\n\t\t\t\tmeanings (\"the Two-Horned\"); and in this they appear to\n\t\t\t\thave been influenced by the ancient Middle-Eastern\n\t\t\t\timagery of \"horns\" as symbols of power and greatness,\n\t\t\t\talthough the Qur\u0027an itself does not offer any warrant for\n\t\t\t\tthis interpretation. In fact, the term -qarn (and its\n\t\t\t\tplural qurun) occurs in the Qur\u0027an-apart from the\n\t\t\t\tcombination Dhu \u0027l-Qarnayn appearing in verses {83}, {86}\n\t\t\t\tand {94} of this surah - twenty times: and each time it\n\t\t\t\thas the meaning of \"generation\" in the sense of people\n\t\t\t\tbelonging to one particular epoch or civilization.\n\t\t\t\tHowever, since the allegory of Dhu \u0027l-Qarnayn is meant to\n\t\t\t\tillustrate the qualities of a powerful and just ruler, it\n\t\t\t\tis possible to assume that this designation is an echo of\n\t\t\t\tthe above-mentioned ancient symbolism, which-being\n\t\t\t\tfamiliar to the Arabs from very early times-had acquired\n\t\t\t\tidiomatic currency in their language long before the\n\t\t\t\tadvent of Islam. Within the context of our Qur\u0027anic\n\t\t\t\tallegory, the \"two horns\" may be taken to denote the two\n\t\t\t\tsources of power with which Dhu \u0027l-Qarnayn is said to\n\t\t\t\thave been endowed: namely, the worldly might and prestige\n\t\t\t\tof kingship as well as the spiritual strength resulting\n\t\t\t\tfrom his faith in God. This last point is extremely\n\t\t\t\timportant- for it is precisely the Qur\u0027anic stress on his\n\t\t\t\tfaith in God that makes it impossible to identify Dhu\n\t\t\t\t\u0027l-Qarnayn, as most of the commentators do, with\n\t\t\t\tAlexander the Great (who is represented on some of his\n\t\t\t\tcoins with two horns on his head) or with one or another\n\t\t\t\tof the pre-Islamic, Himyaritic kings of Yemen. All those\n\t\t\t\thistoric personages were pagans and worshipped a\n\t\t\t\tplurality of deities as a matter of course, whereas our\n\t\t\t\tDhu \u0027l-Qarnayn is depicted as a firm believer in the One\n\t\t\t\tGod: indeed, it is this aspect of his personality that\n\t\t\t\tprovides the innermost reason of the Qur\u0027anic allegory.\n\t\t\t\tWe must, therefore, conclude that the latter has nothing\n\t\t\t\tto do with history or even legend, and that its sole\n\t\t\t\tpurport is a parabolic discourse on faith and ethics,\n\t\t\t\twith specific reference to the problem of worldly power\n\t\t\t\t(see the concluding passage in the introductory note to\n\t\t\t\tthis surah)."

        "Body":  "The classical commentators are of the opinion that this\n\t\t\t\tlast clause refers to actual family relations, as\n\t\t\t\tdistinct from the spiritual brotherhood based on a\n\t\t\t\tcommunity of faith. According to these commentators, the\n\t\t\t\tabove sentence abolished the custom which was prevalent\n\t\t\t\tamong the early Muslims, whereby the ansar (\"the helpers\"\n\t\t\t\t- i.e., the newly-converted Muslims of Medina) concluded,\n\t\t\t\tindividually, symbolic ties of brotherhood with the\n\t\t\t\tmahajirin (\"the emigrants\" from Mecca), who, almost\n\t\t\t\twithout exception, arrived at medina in a state of\n\t\t\t\tcomplete destitution: ties of brotherhood, that is, which\n\t\t\t\tentitled every muhajir to a share in the property of his\n\t\t\t\t\"brother\" from among the ansar, and, in the event of the\n\t\t\t\tlatter\u0027s death, to a share in the inheritance left by\n\t\t\t\thim. The above verse is said to have prohibited such\n\t\t\t\tarrangements by stipulating that only actual close\n\t\t\t\trelations should henceforth have a claim to inheritance.\n\t\t\t\tTo my mind, however, this interpretation is not\n\t\t\t\tconvincing. Although the expression ulu \u0027l-arham is\n\t\t\t\tderived from the noun rahm (also spelt rihm and rahim),\n\t\t\t\twhich literally signifies \"womb\", one should not forget\n\t\t\t\tthat it is tropically used in the sense of \"kinship\",\n\t\t\t\t\"relationship\" or \"close relationship\" in general (i.e.,\n\t\t\t\tnot merely blood-relationship). Thus, \"in the classical\n\t\t\t\tlanguage, ulu \u0027l-arham means any relations: and in law,\n\t\t\t\tany relations that have no portion [of the inheritances\n\t\t\t\ttermed fara\u0027id]\" (Lane III, 1056, citing, among other\n\t\t\t\tauthorities, the Taj al-\u0027Arus). In the present instance,\n\t\t\t\tthe reference to \"close relations\" comes at the end of a\n\t\t\t\tpassage which centres on the injunction that the\n\t\t\t\tbelievers must be \"the friends and protectors (awliya\u0027)\n\t\t\t\tof one another\", and that all later believers shall,\n\t\t\t\tsimilarly, be regarded as members of the Islamic\n\t\t\t\tbrotherhood. If the reference to \"close relations\" were\n\t\t\t\tmeant to be taken in its literal sense and conceived as\n\t\t\t\talluding to laws of inheritance, it would be quite out of\n\t\t\t\ttune with the rest of the passage, which stresses the\n\t\t\t\tbonds of faith among true believers, as well as the moral\n\t\t\t\tobligations arising from these bonds. In my opinion,\n\t\t\t\ttherefore, the above verse has no bearing on laws of\n\t\t\t\tinheritance, but is meant to summarize, as it were, the\n\t\t\t\tlesson of the preceding verses: All true believers, of\n\t\t\t\tall times, form one single community in the deepest sense\n\t\t\t\tof this word; and all who are thus closely related in\n\t\t\t\tspirit have the highest claim on one another in\n\t\t\t\taccordance with God\u0027s decree that \"all believers are\n\t\t\t\tbrethren\" (\u003ca href=\u0027qa:49.10\u0027\u003e49:10\u003c/a\u003e)."

Manar X, 600). Since, however, there is no\n\t\t\t\thistorical evidence of such a \"propensity\" on his part,\n\t\t\t\tit seems to me that what the hypocrites referred to was\n\t\t\t\tthe Prophet\u0027s readiness to listen to what they - in\n\t\t\t\tcommon with many other unbelievers - regarded as mere\n\t\t\t\thallucinatory sounds, and to interpret them \"mistakenly\"\n\t\t\t\tas revelations. This would explain the statement that\n\t\t\t\t\"they malign the Prophet\" - namely, by attributing to him\n\t\t\t\tself-deception - and that this saying of theirs \"amounts\n\t\t\t\tto a denial of the truth\" (see verse {74} of this surah).\n\t\t\t\t- The verb adha signifies primarily \"he molested\" or\n\t\t\t\t\"annoyed [another]\", i.e., in a manner not amounting to\n\t\t\t\tactual harm (darar).

The word ayah (\"message\")\n\t\t\t\toccurring in this context is also used to denote a\n\t\t\t\t\"verse\" of the Qur\u0027an (because every one of these verses\n\t\t\t\tcontains a message). Taking this restricted meaning of\n\t\t\t\tthe term ayah, some scholars conclude from the above\n\t\t\t\tpassage that certain verses of the Qur\u0027an have been\n\t\t\t\t\"abrogated\" by God\u0027s command before the revelation of the\n\t\t\t\tQur\u0027an was completed. Apart from the fancifulness of this\n\t\t\t\tassertion - which calls to mind the image of a human\n\t\t\t\tauthor correcting, on second thought, the proofs of his\n\t\t\t\tmanuscript, deleting one passage and replacing it with\n\t\t\t\tanother - there does not exist a single reliable\n\t\t\t\tTradition to the effect that the Prophet ever declared a\n\t\t\t\tverse of the Qur\u0027an to have been \"abrogated\". At the root\n\t\t\t\tof the so-called \"doctrine of abrogation\" may lie the\n\t\t\t\tinability of some of the early commentators to reconcile\n\t\t\t\tone Qur\u0027anic passage with another: a difficulty which was\n\t\t\t\tovercome by declaring that one of the verses in question\n\t\t\t\thad been \"abrogated\". This arbitrary procedure explains\n\t\t\t\talso why there is no unanimity whatsoever among the\n\t\t\t\tupholders of the \"doctrine of abrogation\" as to which,\n\t\t\t\tand how many, Qur\u0027an-verses have been affected by it;\n\t\t\t\tand, furthermore, as to whether this alleged abrogation\n\t\t\t\timplies a total elimination of the verse in question from\n\t\t\t\tthe context of the Qur\u0027an, or only a cancellation of the\n\t\t\t\tspecific ordinance or statement contained in it. In\n\t\t\t\tshort, the \"doctrine of abrogation\" has no basis whatever\n\t\t\t\tin historical fact, and must be rejected. On the other\n\t\t\t\thand, the apparent difficulty in interpreting the above\n\t\t\t\tQur\u0027anic passage disappears immediately if the term ayah\n\t\t\t\tis understood, correctly, as \"message\", and if we read\n\t\t\t\tthis verse in conjunction with the preceding one, which\n\t\t\t\tstates that the Jews and the Christians refuse to accept\n\t\t\t\tany revelation which might supersede that of the Bible:\n\t\t\t\tfor, if read in this way, the abrogation relates to the\n\t\t\t\tearlier divine messages and not to any part of the Qur\u0027an\n\t\t\t\titself."

Since the Muslims are expected\n\t\t\t\tto organize their communal life within the framework of a\n\t\t\t\tstate based on the ideological premises laid down in the\n\t\t\t\tQur\u0027an, they must be prepared for hostility on the part\n\t\t\t\tof groups or nations opposed to the world-view and the\n\t\t\t\tsocial system of Islam and, conceivably, bent on its\n\t\t\t\tdestruction: consequently, the concept of a defensive war\n\t\t\t\tin God\u0027s cause (jihad) plays a very prominent role in the\n\t\t\t\tsocio-political scheme of Islam and is frequently alluded\n\t\t\t\tto throughout the Qur\u0027an."

As a matter of fact, the Qur\u0027an uses the same\n\t\t\t\texpression in three other places with reference to the\n\t\t\t\tcreation of man in general - namely in {15 :29} and\n\t\t\t\t\u003ca href=\u0027qa:38.72\u0027\u003e38:72\u003c/a\u003e, \"when I have formed him... and breathed into him\n\t\t\t\tof My spirit\"; and in \u003ca href=\u0027qa:32.9\u0027\u003e32:9\u003c/a\u003e, \"and thereupon He forms\n\t\t\t\t[lit., \"formed\"] him fully and breathes [lit.,\n\t\t\t\t\"breathed\"] into him of His spirit\". In particular, the\n\t\t\t\tpassage of which the last-quoted phrase is a part (i.e.,\n\t\t\t\t{32:7-9}) makes it abundantly and explicitly clear that\n\t\t\t\tGod \"breathes of His spirit\" into every human being.\n\t\t\t\tCommenting on the verse under consideration, Zamakhshari\n\t\t\t\tstates that \"the breathing of the spirit [of God] into a\n\t\t\t\tbody signifies the endowing it with life\": an explanation\n\t\t\t\twith which Razi concurs. (In this connection, see also\n\t\t\t\tnote [181] on \u003ca href=\u0027qa:4.171\u0027\u003e4:171\u003c/a\u003e.) As for the description of Mary as\n\t\t\t\tallati ahsanat farjaha, idiomatically denoting \"one who\n\t\t\t\tguarded her chastity\" (lit., \"her private parts\"), it is\n\t\t\t\tto be borne in mind that the term ihsan - lit., \"[one\u0027s]\n\t\t\t\tbeing fortified [against any danger or evil]\" - has the\n\t\t\t\ttropical meaning of \"abstinence from what is unlawful or\n\t\t\t\treprehensible\" (Tarj al-\u0027Arus), and especially from\n\t\t\t\tillicit sexual intercourse, and is applied to a man as\n\t\t\t\twell as a woman: thus, for instance, the terms muhsan and\n\t\t\t\tmuhsanah are used elsewhere in the Qur\u0027an to describe,\n\t\t\t\trespectively, a man or a woman who is \"fortified [by\n\t\t\t\tmarriage] against unchastity\". Hence, the expression\n\t\t\t\tallati ahsanat farjaha, occurring in the above verse as\n\t\t\t\twell as in {66: 12} with reference to Mary, is but meant\n\t\t\t\tto stress her outstanding chastity and complete\n\t\t\t\tabstinence, in thought as well as in deed, from anything\n\t\t\t\tunlawful or morally reprehensible: in other words, a\n\t\t\t\trejection of the calumny (referred to in \u003ca href=\u0027qa:4.156\u0027\u003e4:156\u003c/a\u003e and\n\t\t\t\tobliquely alluded to in {19:27-28}) that the birth of\n\t\t\t\tJesus was the result of an \"illicit union\"."

However, not everything that man regards as\n\t\t\t\t\"evil fortune\" is really, in its final effect, evil -\n\t\t\t\tfor, \"it may well be that you hate a thing the while it\n\t\t\t\tis good for you, and it may well be that you love a thing\n\t\t\t\tthe while it is bad for you: and God knows, whereas you\n\t\t\t\tdo not know\" (\u003ca href=\u0027qa:2.216\u0027\u003e2:216\u003c/a\u003e).

The\n\t\t\t\tstress here is on the intrinsic impossibility of\n\t\t\t\treconciling belief in the One God, whose omniscience and\n\t\t\t\tomnipotence embraces all that exists, with an attribution\n\t\t\t\tof divine or semi-divine qualities and functions to\n\t\t\t\tanyone or anything else. The subtly-veiled suggestion of\n\t\t\t\tthe Thamud (see note [92]) and its rejection by Salih has\n\t\t\t\ta bearing on all religious attitudes based on a desire to\n\t\t\t\t\"bring God closer to man\" through the interposition of\n\t\t\t\talleged \"mediators\" between Him and man. In primitive\n\t\t\t\treligions, this interposition led to the deification of\n\t\t\t\tvarious forces of nature and, subsequently, to the\n\t\t\t\tinvention of imaginary deities which were thought to act\n\t\t\t\tagainst the background of an undefined, dimly-perceived\n\t\t\t\tSupreme Power (for instance, the Moira of the ancient\n\t\t\t\tGreeks). In higher religious concepts, this need for\n\t\t\t\tmediation assumes the form of personified manifestations\n\t\t\t\tof God through subordinate deities (as is the case, in\n\t\t\t\tHinduism, with the personifications of the Absolute\n\t\t\t\tBrahma of the Upanishads and the Vedanta in the forms of\n\t\t\t\tVishnu or Shiva), or in His supposed incarnation in human\n\t\t\t\tform (as represented in the Christian idea of Jesus as\n\t\t\t\t\"God\u0027s son\" and the Second Person of the Trinity). And,\n\t\t\t\tlastly, God is supposedly \"brought closer to man\" by the\n\t\t\t\tinterposition of a hierarchy of saints, living or dead,\n\t\t\t\twhose intercession is sought even by people who consider\n\t\t\t\tthemselves to be \"monotheists\" - and this includes many\n\t\t\t\tmisguided Muslims who do not realize that their belief in\n\t\t\t\tsaints as \"mediators\" between men and God conflicts with\n\t\t\t\tthe very essence of Islam. The ever-recurring Qur\u0027anic\n\t\t\t\tstress on the oneness and uniqueness of God, and the\n\t\t\t\tcategorical denial of the idea that anyone or anything -\n\t\t\t\twhether it be a concrete being or an abstract force -\n\t\t\t\tcould have the least share in God\u0027s qualities or the\n\t\t\t\tleast influence on the manner in which He governs the\n\t\t\t\tuniverse aims at freeing man from the self-imposed\n\t\t\t\tservitude to an imaginary hierarchy of \"mediating\n\t\t\t\tpowers\", and at making him realize that \"wherever you\n\t\t\t\tturn there is God\u0027s countenance\" (2:115), and that God is\n\t\t\t\t\"[always] near, responding [to the call of whoever calls\n\t\t\t\tunto Him]\" (\u003ca href=\u0027qa:2.186\u0027\u003e2:186\u003c/a\u003e; also, in a condensed form, in verse\n\t\t\t\t{61} of this surah)."

This\n\t\t\t\t\"identification\" is mainly based on a well-authenticated\n\t\t\t\tTradition - recorded by Ibn Hanbal, Bukhari and Muslim -\n\t\t\t\twhich tells us that the Apostle of God had a prophetic\n\t\t\t\tdream to which he referred on awakening, with an\n\t\t\t\texclamation of distress: \"There is no deity save God! Woe\n\t\t\t\tunto the Arabs from a misfortune that is approaching: a\n\t\t\t\tlittle gap has been opened today in the rampart of Gog\n\t\t\t\tand Magog!\" Ever since the late Middle Ages, Muslims have\n\t\t\t\tbeen inclined to discern in this dream a prediction of\n\t\t\t\tthe great Mongol invasion in the thirteenth century,\n\t\t\t\twhich destroyed the Abbasid Empire and, thus, the\n\t\t\t\tpolitical power of the Arabs. However, the mention, in\n\t\t\t\tverses {99-101} of this surah, of \"the Day\" - i.e., the\n\t\t\t\tDay of Judgment - in connection with \"Gog and Magog\"\n\t\t\t\tshows that \"the time appointed by my Sustainer\" relates\n\t\t\t\tto the coming of the Last Hour, when all works of man\n\t\t\t\twill be destroyed. But since none of the Qur\u0027anic\n\t\t\t\treferences to the \"approach\" or the \"nearness\" of the\n\t\t\t\tLast Hour has anything to do with the human concept of\n\t\t\t\ttime, it is possible to accept both of the above\n\t\t\t\tinterpretations as equally valid in the sense that the\n\t\t\t\t\"coming of the Last Hour\" comprises an indefinite - and,\n\t\t\t\tin human terms, perhaps even immensely long- span of\n\t\t\t\ttime, and that the break-through of the godless forces of\n\t\t\t\t\"Gog and Magog\" was to be one of the signs of its\n\t\t\t\tapproach. And, finally, it is most logical to assume\n\t\t\t\t(especially on the basis of {21: 96-97}) that the terms\n\t\t\t\tYajuj and Majuj are purely allegorical, applying not to\n\t\t\t\tany specific tribes or beings but to a series of social\n\t\t\t\tcatastrophes which would cause a complete destruction of\n\t\t\t\tman\u0027s civilization before the coming of the Last Hour."

Its prototype is said\n\t\t\t\tto have been built by Abraham as the first temple ever\n\t\t\t\tdedicated to the One God (see \u003ca href=\u0027qa:3.96\u0027\u003e3:96\u003c/a\u003e), and which for this\n\t\t\t\treason has been instituted as the direction of prayer\n\t\t\t\t(qiblah) for all Muslims, and as the goal of the annually\n\t\t\t\trecurring pilgrimage (hajj). It is to be noted that even\n\t\t\t\tin pre-Islamic times the Ka\u0027bah was associated with the\n\t\t\t\tmemory of Abraham, whose personality had always been in\n\t\t\t\tthe foreground of Arabian thought. According to very\n\t\t\t\tancient Arabian traditions, it was at the site of what\n\t\t\t\tlater became Mecca that Abraham, in order to placate\n\t\t\t\tSarah, abandoned his Egyptian bondwoman Hagar and their\n\t\t\t\tchild Ishmael after he had brought them there from\n\t\t\t\tCanaan. This is by no means improbable if one bears in\n\t\t\t\tmind that for a camel-riding bedouin (and Abraham was\n\t\t\t\tcertainly one) a journey of twenty or even thirty days\n\t\t\t\thas never been anything out of the ordinary. At first\n\t\t\t\tglance, the Biblical statement (Genesis xii, 14) that it\n\t\t\t\twas \"in the wilderness of Beersheba\" (i.e., in the\n\t\t\t\tsouthernmost tip of Palestine) that Abraham left Hagar\n\t\t\t\tand Ishmael would seem to conflict with the Qur\u0027anic\n\t\t\t\taccount. This seeming contradiction, however, disappears\n\t\t\t\tas soon as we remember that to the ancient, town-dwelling\n\t\t\t\tHebrews the term \"wilderness of Beersheba\" comprised all\n\t\t\t\tthe desert regions south of Palestine, including the\n\t\t\t\tHijaz. It was at the place where they had been abandoned\n\t\t\t\tthat Hagar and Ishmael, after having discovered the\n\t\t\t\tspring which is now called the Well of Zamzam, eventually\n\t\t\t\tsettled; and it may have been that very spring which in\n\t\t\t\ttime induced a wandering group of bedouin families\n\t\t\t\tbelonging to the South-Arabian (Qahtani) tribe of Jurhum\n\t\t\t\tto settle there. Ishmael later married a girl of this\n\t\t\t\ttribe, and so became the progenitor of the musta\u0027ribah\n\t\t\t\t(\"Arabianized\") tribes - thus called on account of their\n\t\t\t\tdescent from a Hebrew father and a Qahtani mother. As for\n\t\t\t\tAbraham, he is said to have often visited Hagar and\n\t\t\t\tIshmael; and it was on the occasion of one of these\n\t\t\t\tperiodic visits that he, aided by Ishmael, erected the\n\t\t\t\toriginal structure of the Ka\u0027bah. (For more detailed\n\t\t\t\taccounts of the Abrahamic tradition, see Bukhari\u0027s Sahih,\n\t\t\t\tKitab al-\u0027Ilm, Tabari\u0027s Ta\u0027rikh al-Umam, Ibn Sa\u0027d, Ibn\n\t\t\t\tHisham, Mas\u0027udi\u0027s Muruj adh-Dhahab, Yaqut\u0027s Mu\u0027jam\n\t\t\t\tal-Buldan, and other early Muslim historians.)"

As for the term dhurriyyah (lit.,\n\t\t\t\t\"offspring\"), we have several authoritative statements to\n\t\t\t\tthe effect that it often denotes \"a small group [or \"a\n\t\t\t\tfew\"] of one\u0027s people\" (Ibn \u0027Abbas, as quoted by Tabari,\n\t\t\t\tBaghawi, Razi and Ibn Kathir, as well as Ad-Dahhak and\n\t\t\t\tQatadah, as quoted by Tabari and Ibn Kathir); hence my\n\t\t\t\trendering. Since the Qur\u0027an mentions (e.g., in\n\t\t\t\t{7:120-126}) that some Egyptians, too, came to believe in\n\t\t\t\tMoses\u0027 message and openly proclaimed their belief, it is\n\t\t\t\treasonable to assume that by \"his people\" are meant not\n\t\t\t\tmerely the Israelites but, more generally, the people\n\t\t\t\tamong whom Moses was living: that is, both Israelites and\n\t\t\t\tEgyptians. This assumption is strengthened by the\n\t\t\t\treference, in the next clause of this sentence, to \"their\n\t\t\t\tgreat ones\" - an expression obviously relating to the\n\t\t\t\tEgyptian \"great ones\"."

On the other hand, the Qur\u0027an tells us nothing\n\t\t\t\tabout the real nature of that \"tree\" beyond pointing out\n\t\t\t\tthat it was Satan who described it - falsely - as \"the\n\t\t\t\ttree of immortality\": and so we may assume that the\n\t\t\t\tforbidden tree is simply an allegory of the limits which\n\t\t\t\tthe Creator has set to man\u0027s desires and actions: limits\n\t\t\t\tbeyond which he may not go without offending against his\n\t\t\t\town, God-willed nature.

        "Body":  "According to most of the commentators, the invisible\n\t\t\t\tbeings (al-jinn) referred to here are the \"evil forces\"\n\t\t\t\t(shayatin) among them, such as are spoken of in verse\n\t\t\t\t{112} of this surah. It is generally assumed that these\n\t\t\t\tvery beings or forces are addressed here; but the primary\n\t\t\t\tmeaning of the term ma\u0027shar appearing in this context\n\t\t\t\twarrants, in my opinion, a different conclusion. It is\n\t\t\t\ttrue that this term is often used to denote a group or\n\t\t\t\tcommunity or genus of sentient beings which have certain\n\t\t\t\tcharacteristics in common: a conventional - and\n\t\t\t\tundoubtedly justifiable - use based on the verb\n\t\t\t\t\u0027asharahu, \"he consorted [or \"was on intimate terms\"]\n\t\t\t\twith him\" or \"lived in close communion with him\". But it\n\t\t\t\tis precisely this verbal origin of the term ma\u0027shar which\n\t\t\t\tgives us a clue as to what is really meant here. Since,\n\t\t\t\tin its primary significance, a person\u0027s ma\u0027shar denotes\n\t\t\t\tthose who are on intimate terms or in close communion\n\t\t\t\twith him (cf. Lisan al-\u0027Arab: \"A man\u0027s ma\u0027shar is his\n\t\t\t\tfamily\"), we may well assume that it has a similar\n\t\t\t\tsignificance in the above Qur\u0027anic phrase. Thus, to my\n\t\t\t\tmind, the allocution ya ma\u0027shar al-jinn does not denote,\n\t\t\t\t\"O you community of [evil] invisible beings\" but, rather,\n\t\t\t\t\"O you who are [or \"have lived\"] in close communion with\n\t\t\t\t[evil] invisible beings\": in other words, it is addressed\n\t\t\t\tto the misguided human beings who have been seduced by\n\t\t\t\t\"glittering half-truths meant to delude the mind\" {verse\n\t\t\t\t112}. This interpretation is reinforced by the words,\n\t\t\t\t\"Have there not come unto you apostles from among\n\t\t\t\tyourselves\", occurring in verse {130} below: for the\n\t\t\t\tQur\u0027an speaks always only of apostles who belonged to the\n\t\t\t\thuman race, and never of apostles from among the jinn.\n\t\t\t\t(As regards the wide significance of this latter term,\n\t\t\t\tsee Appendix III.)"

Qamus and Taj al-\u0027Arus. If this supposition is\n\t\t\t\tcorrect, the \"stones of petrified clay\" would be more or\n\t\t\t\tless synonymous with \"brimstones\", which in its turn\n\t\t\t\twould point to a volcanic eruption, probably in\n\t\t\t\tconjunction with a severe earthquake (alluded to in the\n\t\t\t\tpreceding phrase, \"We turned those [sinful towns] upside\n\t\t\t\tdown\"). But there is also a strong probability, pointed\n\t\t\t\tout by Zamakhshari and Razi, that the term sijjil is of\n\t\t\t\tpurely Arabic origin - namely, a synonym of sijjil, which\n\t\t\t\tprimarily signifies \"a writing\", and secondarily,\n\t\t\t\t\"something that has been decreed\": in which case the\n\t\t\t\texpression hijarah min sijjil can be understood in a\n\t\t\t\tmetaphorical sense, namely, as \"stones of all the\n\t\t\t\tchastisement laid down in God\u0027s decree\" (Zamakhshari and\n\t\t\t\tRazi, both in conjunction with the above verse and in\n\t\t\t\ttheir commentaries on \u003ca href=\u0027qa:105.4\u0027\u003e105:4\u003c/a\u003e).

About\n\t\t\t\tsixteen months after his arrival at Medina, however, he\n\t\t\t\treceived a revelation (verses {142-150} of this surah)\n\t\t\t\twhich definitively established the Ka\u0027bah as the qiblah\n\t\t\t\tof the followers of the Qur\u0027an. This \"abandonment\" of\n\t\t\t\tJerusalem obviously displeased the Jews of Medina, who\n\t\t\t\tmust have felt gratified when they saw the Muslims\n\t\t\t\tpraying towards their holy city; and it is to them that\n\t\t\t\tthe opening sentence of this passage refers. If one\n\t\t\t\tconsiders the matter from the historical point of view,\n\t\t\t\tthere had never been any change in the divine\n\t\t\t\tcommandments relating to the qiblah: there had simply\n\t\t\t\tbeen no ordinance whatever in this respect before verses\n\t\t\t\t{142-150} were revealed. Their logical connection with\n\t\t\t\tthe preceding passages, which deal, in the main, with\n\t\t\t\tAbraham and his creed, lies in the fact that it was\n\t\t\t\tAbraham who erected the earliest structure of the temple\n\t\t\t\twhich later came to be known as the Ka\u0027bah."

The Prophet\n\t\t\t\ttook this request as a sign of Ibn Ubayy\u0027s repentance,\n\t\t\t\tand gave him his shirt and later led the funeral prayers\n\t\t\t\tover his body.

However, neither the interrogative nor\n\t\t\t\tthe above-mentioned literal rendering would bring out the\n\t\t\t\tpurport of this passage. Its meaning becomes obvious only\n\t\t\t\tif we remember that law-la is - apart from its primary\n\t\t\t\tsignificance - one of the so-called huruf at-tahdid\n\t\t\t\t(\"particles denoting insistence\"). Whenever it is\n\t\t\t\tfollowed by a verb in the future tense, it expresses an\n\t\t\t\turgent exhortation to do a thing; if followed by a verb\n\t\t\t\tin the past tense, as in the above case, it implies\n\t\t\t\treproof for one\u0027s not having done something that should\n\t\t\t\thave been done. There is no idiomatic equivalent in\n\t\t\t\tmodern English to convey this meaning. The nearest\n\t\t\t\tapproach to it would be, I believe, the archaic\n\t\t\t\texclamation \"alack\", expressive of deep sorrow or\n\t\t\t\treproach; but the use of this expression (probably a\n\t\t\t\tcompound of \"ah! lack!\" - i.e., loss or misfortune) is\n\t\t\t\truled out by its obsoleteness. Consequently, I am\n\t\t\t\tconstrained to employ the more current interjection\n\t\t\t\t\"alas\", despite the fact that it does not possess the\n\t\t\t\tintensity of the ancient \"alack\". At any rate, the reader\n\t\t\t\tmust bear in mind that the passage under consideration,\n\t\t\t\talthough seemingly phrased in a conditional or an\n\t\t\t\tinterrogatory form, implies a positive statement: namely\n\t\t\t\t- as has been stressed by several classical commentators,\n\t\t\t\tand most explicitly by Tabari - the statement that \"there\n\t\t\t\thas never yet been...\", etc."

An\n\t\t\t\tillustration of this problem has been provided in the\n\t\t\t\tfollowing authentic Tradition, quoted by Muslim on the\n\t\t\t\tauthority of Abu Hurayrah. In one of his sermons, the\n\t\t\t\tProphet said: \"O my people! God has ordained the\n\t\t\t\tpilgrimage (al-hajj) for you; therefore perform it.\"\n\t\t\t\tThereupon somebody asked, \"Every year, O Apostle of God?\"\n\t\t\t\tThe Prophet remained silent; and the man repeated his\n\t\t\t\tquestion twice. Then the Prophet said: \"Had I answered\n\t\t\t\t\u0027yes\u0027, it would have become incumbent on you [to perform\n\t\t\t\tthe pilgrimage every year]: and, indeed, it would have\n\t\t\t\tbeen beyond your ability to do so. Do not ask me about\n\t\t\t\tmatters which I leave unspoken: for, behold, there were\n\t\t\t\tpeople before you who went to their doom because they had\n\t\t\t\tput too many questions to their prophets and thereupon\n\t\t\t\tdisagreed [about their teachings]. Therefore, if I\n\t\t\t\tcommand you anything, do of it as much as you are able to\n\t\t\t\tdo; and if I forbid you anything, abstain from it.\"\n\t\t\t\tDiscussing this Tradition, Ibn Hazm observes: \"It\n\t\t\t\tcircumscribes all the principles of religious law (ahkam\n\t\t\t\tad-din) from the first to the last - namely: what the\n\t\t\t\tProphet has left unspoken - neither ordering nor\n\t\t\t\tforbidding it - is allowed (mubah), that is, neither\n\t\t\t\tforbidden nor obligatory; whatever he ordered is\n\t\t\t\tobligatory (fard), and whatever he forbade is unlawful\n\t\t\t\t(haram); and whatever he ordered us to do is binding on\n\t\t\t\tus to the extent of our ability alone\" (Muhalla I, 64).\n\t\t\t\tIt should be borne in mind that the term \"the Prophet\"\n\t\t\t\tcomprises, in this context, the Qur\u0027an as well, since it\n\t\t\t\twas through the Prophet that the Qur\u0027anic message was\n\t\t\t\tcommunicated to mankind."

The\n\t\t\t\tstatement that \"every community faces a direction of its\n\t\t\t\town\" in its endeavour to express its submission to God\n\t\t\t\timplies, firstly, that at various times and in various\n\t\t\t\tcircumstances man\u0027s desire to approach God in prayer has\n\t\t\t\ttaken different forms (e.g., Abraham\u0027s choice of the\n\t\t\t\tKa\u0027bah as his qiblah, the Jewish concentration on\n\t\t\t\tJerusalem, the eastward orientation of the early\n\t\t\t\tChristian churches, and the Qur\u0027anic commandment relating\n\t\t\t\tto the Ka\u0027bah); and, secondly, that the direction of\n\t\t\t\tprayer - however important its symbolic significance may\n\t\t\t\tbe - does not represent the essence of faith as such:\n\t\t\t\tfor, as the Qur\u0027an says, \"true piety does not consist in\n\t\t\t\tturning your faces towards the east or the west\"\n\t\t\t\t(\u003ca href=\u0027qa:2.177\u0027\u003e2:177\u003c/a\u003e), and, \"God\u0027s is the east and the west\" (\u003ca href=\u0027qa:2.115\u0027\u003e2:115\u003c/a\u003e\n\t\t\t\tand {142}). Consequently, the revelation which\n\t\t\t\testablished the Ka\u0027bah as the qiblah of the Muslims\n\t\t\t\tshould not be a matter of contention for people of other\n\t\t\t\tfaiths, nor a cause of their disbelief in the truth of\n\t\t\t\tthe Qur\u0027anic revelation as such (Manar II, 21 f.)."

While the\n\t\t\t\tphysical exodus from Mecca to Medina ceased to be\n\t\t\t\tobligatory for the believers after the conquest of Mecca\n\t\t\t\tin the year 8 H., the spiritual exodus from the domain of\n\t\t\t\tevil to that of righteousness continues to be a\n\t\t\t\tfundamental demand of Islam: in other words, a person who\n\t\t\t\tdoes not \"migrate from evil unto God\" cannot be\n\t\t\t\tconsidered a believer - which explains the condemnation,\n\t\t\t\tin the next sentence, of all who are remiss in this\n\t\t\t\trespect."

Although, according to the teachings of\n\t\t\t\tIslam, the Mosaic dispensation has since been abrogated,\n\t\t\t\tthe Qur\u0027an frequently points out its great role in the\n\t\t\t\thistory of man\u0027s monotheistic beliefs, and stresses again\n\t\t\t\tand again its (time-bound) importance as a means of\n\t\t\t\tenforcing spiritual discipline on the children of Israel.\n\t\t\t\tTheir repeated, deliberate breaches of the Mosaic Law are\n\t\t\t\tshown as evidence of their rebellious attitude towards\n\t\t\t\tthat discipline and, thus, towards God\u0027s commandments in\n\t\t\t\tgeneral."

Verses\n\t\t\t\t{172-175} are an instance of this. Some commentators are\n\t\t\t\tof the opinion that they refer to the fruitless\n\t\t\t\texpedition to Hamra\u0027al-Asad on the day following the\n\t\t\t\tbattle of Uhud, while others see in it an allusion to the\n\t\t\t\tProphet\u0027s expedition, in the following year, known to\n\t\t\t\thistory as the \"Little Badr\" (Badr as-Sughra); others,\n\t\t\t\tagain, think that verse {172} refers to the former and\n\t\t\t\tverses {173-174} to the latter. In view of this obvious\n\t\t\t\tlack of unanimity - due to the absence of a really\n\t\t\t\tauthoritative support, either in the Qur\u0027an itself or in\n\t\t\t\tauthentic Traditions, for any of these speculative\n\t\t\t\tassumptions - there is every reason for concluding that\n\t\t\t\tthe whole passage under consideration expresses a general\n\t\t\t\tmoral, rounding off, as it were, the historical\n\t\t\t\treferences to the battle of Uhud and the lessons to be\n\t\t\t\tdrawn therefrom."

This interpretation, however, is not\n\t\t\t\tplausible. Apart from the fact that the believers are\n\t\t\t\there referred to in the third person. while ma antum\n\t\t\t\t\u0027alayhi is in the second person plural, the latter\n\t\t\t\texpression denotes almost invariably, both in the Qur\u0027an\n\t\t\t\tand in the Traditions, people\u0027s mode of life and beliefs.\n\t\t\t\tMoreover, we have reliable reports to the effect that Ibn\n\t\t\t\t\u0027Abbas, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak, Muqatil and Al-Kalbi\n\t\t\t\tunhesitatingly declared that the people addressed here\n\t\t\t\tare \"those who deny the truth\" to whom the preceding\n\t\t\t\tpassages refer (see Tabari\u0027s and Baghawi\u0027s commentaries\n\t\t\t\ton this verse).

Inasmuch as, on the face of it, this\n\t\t\t\treading would imply a fundamental doubt in God\u0027s power to\n\t\t\t\tdo anything that He wills (an imputation which does not\n\t\t\t\tagree with the characterization, in the Qur\u0027an, of Jesus\u0027\n\t\t\t\tdisciples as firm believers), most of the commentators\n\t\t\t\tsee in the query of the disciples something similar to\n\t\t\t\tone person\u0027s asking another, \"Could you go with me?\" -\n\t\t\t\tthat is to say, not implying a doubt as to the other\u0027s\n\t\t\t\tability to go but, rather, an uncertainty as to his\n\t\t\t\twillingness to do it (cf. in this respect, Tabari,\n\t\t\t\tBaghawi, Razi, Raghib; also Manar VII, 250ff.). We have,\n\t\t\t\thowever, positive evidence of the fact that several of\n\t\t\t\tthe most outstanding Companions of the Prophet - \u0027Ali,\n\t\t\t\tIbn \u0027Abbas, \u0027A\u0027ishah and Mu\u0027adh ibn Jabal - read the\n\t\t\t\twords in question in the spelling hal tastati\u0027 rabbaka,\n\t\t\t\twhich might be rendered as \"Couldst thou prevail upon thy\n\t\t\t\tSustainer?\" (Tabari, Zamakhshari, Baghawi, Razi, Ibn\n\t\t\t\tKathir): a reading which implies the disciples\u0027\n\t\t\t\tuncertainty as to Jesus\u0027 ability (in the spiritual sense\n\t\t\t\tof this word) to make the above request of God. Thus,\n\t\t\t\t\u0027A\u0027ishah, refusing to accept the more common reading hal\n\t\t\t\tyastati\u0027 rabbuka (\"can\" or \"could thy Sustainer\"), is\n\t\t\t\treported to have said: \"The disciples of Jesus knew\n\t\t\t\tbetter than to ask whether God is able to do anything:\n\t\t\t\tthey merely asked [of Jesus], \u0027Art thou able to request\n\t\t\t\tthy Sustainer?\u0027\" (Razi). Moreover, according to an\n\t\t\t\tauthentic Tradition quoted in the Mustadrak, Mu\u0027adh ibn\n\t\t\t\tJabal stated unequivocally that the Prophet himself had\n\t\t\t\timparted to him the reading hal tastati\u0027 rabbaka\n\t\t\t\t(\"Couldst thou prevail upon thy Sustainer?\"). To my mind,\n\t\t\t\tthe weight of evidence points to this second alternative:\n\t\t\t\tbut in view of the more general reading, I have rendered\n\t\t\t\tthe phrase as above. As regards the disciples\u0027 request -\n\t\t\t\tand Jesus\u0027 subsequent prayer - for a heavenly \"repast\"\n\t\t\t\t(ma\u0027idah, the word which gave the title to this surah),\n\t\t\t\tit might possibly be an echo of the request for daily\n\t\t\t\tbread contained in the Lord\u0027s Prayer (cf. Matthew vi,\n\t\t\t\t11), since, in religious terminology, every benefit that\n\t\t\t\taccrues to man is \"sent down from heaven\" - that is, by\n\t\t\t\tGod - even if it comes into being through man\u0027s own\n\t\t\t\tefforts. But, on the other hand, the manner in which the\n\t\t\t\tdisciples are said to have asked for the \"repast\" - and\n\t\t\t\tparticularly their explanation given in the next verse -\n\t\t\t\trather seems to point to a request for a miracle which\n\t\t\t\twould assure them of God\u0027s \"acceptance\" of their faith.\n\t\t\t\t(See also next note.)"

Hence, according to some\n\t\t\t\tphilologists, the plural form inath signifies \"inanimate\n\t\t\t\tthings\" (cf. Lane I, 112). Ibn \u0027Abbas, Qatadah and\n\t\t\t\tAl-Hasan al Basri explain it as denoting anything that is\n\t\t\t\tpassive and lifeless (Tabari); this definition has been\n\t\t\t\tadopted by Raghib as well.

The\n\t\t\t\thistorical occasion to which this verse refers may be\n\t\t\t\tthus summarized: Ever since his exodus from Mecca to\n\t\t\t\tMedina the Prophet was violently opposed by one Abu \u0027Amir\n\t\t\t\t(\"The Monk\"), a prominent member of the Khazraj tribe,\n\t\t\t\twho had embraced Christianity many years earlier and\n\t\t\t\tenjoyed a considerable reputation among his compatriots\n\t\t\t\tand among the Christians of Syria. From the very outset\n\t\t\t\the allied himself with the Prophet\u0027s enemies, the Meccan\n\t\t\t\tQuraysh, and took part on their side in the battle of\n\t\t\t\tUhud (3 H.). Shortly thereafter he migrated to Syria and\n\t\t\t\tdid all that he could to induce the Emperor of Byzantium,\n\t\t\t\tHeraclius, to invade Medina and crush the Muslim\n\t\t\t\tcommunity once and for all. In Medina itself, Abu \u0027Amir\n\t\t\t\thad some secret followers among the members of his tribe,\n\t\t\t\twith whom he remained in constant correspondence. In the\n\t\t\t\tyear 9 H. he informed them that Heraclius had agreed to\n\t\t\t\tsend out an army against Medina, and that large-scale\n\t\t\t\tpreparations were being made to this effect (which was\n\t\t\t\tapparently the reason for the Prophet\u0027s preventive\n\t\t\t\texpedition to Tabak). In order that his followers should\n\t\t\t\thave a rallying-place in the event of the expected\n\t\t\t\tinvasion of Medina, Abu \u0027Amir suggested to his friends\n\t\t\t\tthat they build a mosque of their own in the village of\n\t\t\t\tQuba\u0027, in the immediate vicinity of Medina (which they\n\t\t\t\tdid), and thus obviate the necessity of congregating in\n\t\t\t\tthe mosque which the Prophet himself had built in the\n\t\t\t\tsame village at the time of his arrival at Medina (see\n\t\t\t\tnote [145] below). It is this \"rival\" mosque to which the\n\t\t\t\tabove verse refers. It was demolished at the Prophet\u0027s\n\t\t\t\torders immediately after his return from the Tabak\n\t\t\t\texpedition. Abu \u0027Amir himself died in Syria shortly\n\t\t\t\tafterwards. (For all the relevant Traditions, see\n\t\t\t\tTabari\u0027s and Ibn Kathir\u0027s commentaries on this verse.)"

By including this kind of\n\t\t\t\texpenditure within the essential acts of piety, the\n\t\t\t\tQur\u0027an implies that the freeing of people from bondage -\n\t\t\t\tand, thus, the abolition of slavery - is one of the\n\t\t\t\tsocial objectives of Islam. At the time of the revelation\n\t\t\t\tof the Qur\u0027an, slavery was an established institution\n\t\t\t\tthroughout the world, and its sudden abolition would have\n\t\t\t\tbeen economically impossible. In order to obviate this\n\t\t\t\tdifficulty, and at the same time to bring about an\n\t\t\t\teventual abolition of all slavery, the Qur\u0027an ordains in\n\t\t\t\t\u003ca href=\u0027qa:8.67\u0027\u003e8:67\u003c/a\u003e that henceforth only captives taken in a just war\n\t\t\t\t(jihad) may be kept as slaves.

In addition, the\n\t\t\t\tProphet emphatically stated on many occasions that, in\n\t\t\t\tthe sight of God, the unconditional freeing of a human\n\t\t\t\tbeing from bondage is among the most praiseworthy acts\n\t\t\t\twhich a Muslim could perform.

        "Body":  "After having pointed out that true piety does not consist\n\t\t\t\tin mere adherence to outward forms and rites, the Qur\u0027an\n\t\t\t\topens, as it were, a new chapter relating to the problem\n\t\t\t\tof man\u0027s behaviour. Just as piety cannot become effective\n\t\t\t\twithout righteous action, individual righteousness cannot\n\t\t\t\tbecome really effective in the social sense unless there\n\t\t\t\tis agreement within the community as to the social rights\n\t\t\t\tand obligations of its members: in other words, as to the\n\t\t\t\tpractical laws which should govern the behaviour of the\n\t\t\t\tindividual within the society and the society\u0027s attitude\n\t\t\t\ttowards the individual and his actions. This is the\n\t\t\t\tinnermost reason why legislation plays so great a role\n\t\t\t\twithin the ideology of Islam, and why the Qur\u0027an\n\t\t\t\tconsistently intertwines its moral and spiritual\n\t\t\t\texhortation with ordinances relating to practical aspects\n\t\t\t\tof social life. Now one of the main problems facing any\n\t\t\t\tsociety is the safeguarding of the lives and the\n\t\t\t\tindividual security of its members: and so it is\n\t\t\t\tunderstandable that laws relating to homicide and its\n\t\t\t\tpunishment are dealt with prominently at this place. (It\n\t\t\t\tshould be borne in mind that \"The Cow\" was the first\n\t\t\t\tsurah revealed in Medina, that is, at the time when the\n\t\t\t\tMuslim community had just become established as an\n\t\t\t\tindependent social entity.) As for the term qisas\n\t\t\t\toccurring at the beginning of the above passage, it must\n\t\t\t\tbe pointed out that - according to all the classical\n\t\t\t\tcommentators - it is almost synonymous with musawah,\n\t\t\t\ti.e., \"making a thing equal [to another thing]\": in this\n\t\t\t\tinstance, making the punishment equal (or appropriate) to\n\t\t\t\tthe crime - a meaning which is best rendered as \"just\n\t\t\t\tretribution\" and not (as has been often, and erroneously,\n\t\t\t\tdone) as \"retaliation\". Seeing that the Qur\u0027an speaks\n\t\t\t\there of \"cases of killing\" (fi \u0027l-qatla, lit., \"in the\n\t\t\t\tmatter of the killed\") in general, and taking into\n\t\t\t\taccount that this expression covers all possible cases of\n\t\t\t\thomicide - premeditated murder, murder under extreme\n\t\t\t\tprovocation, culpable homicide, accidental manslaughter,\n\t\t\t\tand so forth - it is obvious that the taking of a life\n\t\t\t\tfor a life (implied in the term \"retaliation\") would not\n\t\t\t\tin every case correspond to the demands of equity. (This\n\t\t\t\thas been made clear, for instance, in \u003ca href=\u0027qa:4.92\u0027\u003e4:92\u003c/a\u003e, where legal\n\t\t\t\trestitution for unintentional homicide is dealt with.)\n\t\t\t\tRead in conjunction with the term \"just retribution\"\n\t\t\t\twhich introduces this passage, it is clear that the\n\t\t\t\tstipulation \"the free for the free, the slave for the\n\t\t\t\tslave, the woman for the woman\" cannot - and has not been\n\t\t\t\tintended to - be taken in its literal, restrictive sense:\n\t\t\t\tfor this would preclude its application to many cases of\n\t\t\t\thomicide, e.g., the killing of a free man by a slave, or\n\t\t\t\tof a woman by a man, or vice-versa. Thus, the above\n\t\t\t\tstipulation must be regarded as an example of the\n\t\t\t\telliptical mode of expression (ijaz) so frequently\n\t\t\t\temployed in the Qur\u0027an, and can have but one meaning,\n\t\t\t\tnamely: \"if a free man has committed the crime, the free\n\t\t\t\tman must be punished; if a slave has commited the\n\t\t\t\tcrime...\", etc. - in other words, whatever the status of\n\t\t\t\tthe guilty person, he or she (and he or she alone) is to\n\t\t\t\tbe punished in a manner appropriate to the crime."

Since a man who is fully\n\t\t\t\tconscious of his moral responsibility might feel that he\n\t\t\t\tis committing a sin if he loves one of his wives more\n\t\t\t\tthan the other (or others), the above verse provides a\n\t\t\t\t\"judicial enlightenment\" on this point by making it clear\n\t\t\t\tthat feelings are beyond a human being\u0027s control: in\n\t\t\t\tother words, that the required equality of treatment\n\t\t\t\trelates only to outward behaviour towards and practical\n\t\t\t\tdealings with one\u0027s wives.

There is no linguistic justification whatever\n\t\t\t\tfor attributing - as some of the commentators have done -\n\t\t\t\tthe pronoun \"his\" to the victim and, thus, for assuming\n\t\t\t\tthat the expression \"brother\" stands for the victim\u0027s\n\t\t\t\t\"family\" or \"blood relations\". The pronoun \"his\" refers,\n\t\t\t\tunquestionably, to the guilty person; and since there is\n\t\t\t\tno reason for assuming that by \"his brother\" a real\n\t\t\t\tbrother is meant, we cannot escape the conclusion that it\n\t\t\t\tdenotes here \"his brother in faith\" of \"his fellow-man\" -\n\t\t\t\tin either of which terms the whole community is included.\n\t\t\t\tThus, the expression \"if something is remitted to a\n\t\t\t\tguilty person by his brother\" (i.e., by the community or\n\t\t\t\tits legal organs) may refer either to the establishment\n\t\t\t\tof mitigating circumstances in a case of murder, or to\n\t\t\t\tthe finding that the case under trial falls within the\n\t\t\t\tcategories of culpable homicide or manslaughter - in\n\t\t\t\twhich cases no capital punishment is to be exacted and\n\t\t\t\trestitution is to be made by the payment of an indemnity\n\t\t\t\tcalled diyyah (see \u003ca href=\u0027qa:4.92\u0027\u003e4:92\u003c/a\u003e) to the relatives of the\n\t\t\t\tvictim.

Explaining the above verse in this sense, Razi says:\n\t\t\t\t\"God\u0027s chastisement does not afflict any people merely on\n\t\t\t\taccount of their holding beliefs amounting to shirk and\n\t\t\t\tkafr, but afflicts them only if they persistently commit\n\t\t\t\tevil in their mutual dealings, and deliberately hurt\n\t\t\t\t[other human beings] and act tyranically [towards them].\n\t\t\t\tHence, those who are learned in Islamic Law (al-fuqaha\u0027)\n\t\t\t\thold that men\u0027s obligations towards God rest on the\n\t\t\t\tprinciple of [His] forgiveness and liberality, whereas\n\t\t\t\tthe rights of man are of a stringent nature and must\n\t\t\t\talways be strictly observed\" - the obvious reason being\n\t\t\t\tthat God is almighty and needs no defender, whereas man\n\t\t\t\tis weak and needs protection. (Cf. the last sentence of\n\t\t\t\t\u003ca href=\u0027qa:28.59\u0027\u003e28:59\u003c/a\u003e and the corresponding note [61].)"

Although the above\n\t\t\t\tinjunction mentions specifically religious knowledge, it\n\t\t\t\thas a positive bearing on every kind of knowledge - and\n\t\t\t\tthis in view of the fact that the Qur\u0027an does not draw\n\t\t\t\tany dividing-line between the spiritual and the worldly\n\t\t\t\tconcerns of life but, rather, regards them as different\n\t\t\t\taspects of one and the same reality. In many of its\n\t\t\t\tverses, the Qur\u0027an calls upon the believer to observe all\n\t\t\t\tnature and to discern God\u0027s creative activity in its\n\t\t\t\tmanifold phenomena and \"laws\", as well as to mediate upon\n\t\t\t\tthe lessons of history with a view to gaining a deeper\n\t\t\t\tinsight into man\u0027s motivations and the innermost springs\n\t\t\t\tof his behaviour; and, thus, the Qur\u0027an itself is\n\t\t\t\tcharacterized as addressed to \"those who think\". In\n\t\t\t\tshort, intellectual activity as such is postulated as a\n\t\t\t\tvalid way to a better understanding of God\u0027s will and -\n\t\t\t\tif pursued with moral consciousness - as a valid method\n\t\t\t\tof worshipping God. This Qur\u0027anic principle has been\n\t\t\t\temphasized in many well-authenticated sayings of the\n\t\t\t\tProphet, for instance, \"Striving after knowledge is a\n\t\t\t\tsacred duty (faridah) for every man and woman who has\n\t\t\t\tsurrendered himself or herself to God (muslim\n\t\t\t\twa-muslimah)\" (Ibn Majah); or, \"The superiority (fadl) of\n\t\t\t\ta learned man over a [mere] worshipper [i.e., one who\n\t\t\t\tmerely prays, fasts, etc.] is like the superiority of the\n\t\t\t\tfull moon over all the stars\" (Tirmidhi, Abu Da\u0027ud, Ibn\n\t\t\t\tMajah, Ibn Hanbal, Darimi). Consequently, the obligation\n\t\t\t\tof the believers to \"devote themselves to acquiring a\n\t\t\t\tdeeper knowledge of the Faith\" (li-yatafaqqahu fi \u0027d-din)\n\t\t\t\tand to impart its results to their fellow-believers\n\t\t\t\trelates to every branch of knowledge as well as to its\n\t\t\t\tpractical application."

        "Body":  "Thus, the Qur\u0027an categorically denies the story of the\n\t\t\t\tcrucifixion of Jesus. There exist, among Muslims, many\n\t\t\t\tfanciful legends telling us that at the last moment God\n\t\t\t\tsubstituted for Jesus a person closely resembling him\n\t\t\t\t(according to some accounts, that person was Judas), who\n\t\t\t\twas subsequently crucified in his place. However, none of\n\t\t\t\tthese legends finds the slightest support in the Qur\u0027an\n\t\t\t\tor in authentic Traditions, and the stories produced in\n\t\t\t\tthis connection by the classical commentators must be\n\t\t\t\tsummarily rejected. They represent no more than confused\n\t\t\t\tattempts at \"harmonizing\" the Qur\u0027anic statement that\n\t\t\t\tJesus was not crucified with the graphic description, in\n\t\t\t\tthe Gospels, of his crucifixion. The story of the\n\t\t\t\tcrucifixion as such has been succinctly explained in the\n\t\t\t\tQur\u0027anic phrase wa-lakin shubbiha lahum, which I render\n\t\t\t\tas \"but it only appeared to them as if it had been so\" -\n\t\t\t\timplying that in the course of time, long after the time\n\t\t\t\tof Jesus, a legend had somehow grown up (possibly under\n\t\t\t\tthe then-powerful influence of Mithraistic beliefs) to\n\t\t\t\tthe effect that he had died on the cross in order to\n\t\t\t\tatone for the \"original sin\" with which mankind is\n\t\t\t\tallegedly burdened; and this legend became so firmly\n\t\t\t\testablished among the latter-day followers of Jesus that\n\t\t\t\teven his enemies, the Jews, began to believe it - albeit\n\t\t\t\tin a derogatory sense (for crucifixion was, in those\n\t\t\t\ttimes, a heinous form of death-penalty reserved for the\n\t\t\t\tlowest of criminals). This, to my mind, is the only\n\t\t\t\tsatisfactory explanation of the phrase wa-lakin shubbiha\n\t\t\t\tlahum, the more so as the expression shubbiha li is\n\t\t\t\tidiomatically synonymous with khuyyila li, \"[a thing]\n\t\t\t\tbecame a fancied image to me\", i.e., \"in my mind\" - in\n\t\t\t\tother words, \"[it] seemed to me\" (see Qamus, art.\n\t\t\t\tkhayala, as well as Lane II, 833, and IV, 1500)."

Most of the commentators see in this sentence\n\t\t\t\tan indication of a conscious intent on the part of the\n\t\t\t\tperson thus described; but it is also possible that the\n\t\t\t\tparticle li in li-yufsida (generally taken to mean \"in\n\t\t\t\torder that he might spread corruption\") plays in this\n\t\t\t\tcontext the role of what the grammarians call a lam\n\t\t\t\tal-\u0027aqibah, \"the [letter] lam used to denote a\n\t\t\t\tconsequence\" - i.e., regardless of the existence or\n\t\t\t\tnon-existence of a conscious intent. (By rendering the\n\t\t\t\tsentence the way I do it, both possibilities are left\n\t\t\t\topen.) As regards the expression harth (rendered by me as\n\t\t\t\t\"tilth\"), its primary significance is \"gain\" or\n\t\t\t\t\"acquisition\" through labour; and thus it often signifies\n\t\t\t\t\"worldly goods\" (see Lane II, 542), and especially the\n\t\t\t\tcrops obtained by tilling land, as well as the tilled\n\t\t\t\tland itself. If harth is understood in this context as\n\t\t\t\t\"tilth\", it would apply, metaphorically, to human\n\t\t\t\tendeavours in general, and to social endeavours in\n\t\t\t\tparticular. However, some commentators - basing their\n\t\t\t\topinion on the Qur\u0027anic sentence, \"your wives are your\n\t\t\t\ttilth\" (\u003ca href=\u0027qa:2.223\u0027\u003e2:223\u003c/a\u003e)- maintain that harth stands here for\n\t\t\t\t\"wives\" (cf. Razi, and the philologist Al-Azhari, as\n\t\t\t\tquoted in Manar II, 248): in which case the \"destruction\n\t\t\t\tof tilth and progeny\" would be synonymous with an\n\t\t\t\tupsetting of family life and, consequently, of the entire\n\t\t\t\tsocial fabric. According to either of these two\n\t\t\t\tinterpretations, the passage has the following meaning:\n\t\t\t\tAs soon as the mental attitude described above is\n\t\t\t\tgenerally accepted and made the basis of social\n\t\t\t\tbehaviour, it unavoidably results in widespread moral\n\t\t\t\tdecay and, consequently, social disintegration."

What is alluded to in this\n\t\t\t\tverse is no more than the relative homogeneity of\n\t\t\t\tinstinctive perceptions and inclinations characteristic\n\t\t\t\tof man\u0027s primitive mentality and the primitive social\n\t\t\t\torder in which he lived in those early days. Since that\n\t\t\t\thomogeneity was based on a lack of intellectual and\n\t\t\t\temotional differentiation rather than on a conscious\n\t\t\t\tagreement among the members of human society, it was\n\t\t\t\tbound to disintegrate in the measure of man\u0027s subsequent\n\t\t\t\tdevelopment. As his thought-life became more and more\n\t\t\t\tcomplex, his emotional capacity and his individual needs,\n\t\t\t\ttoo, became more differentiated, conflicts of views and\n\t\t\t\tinterests came to the fore, and mankind ceased to be \"one\n\t\t\t\tsingle community\" as regards their outlook on life and\n\t\t\t\ttheir moral valuations: and it was at this stage that\n\t\t\t\tdivine guidance became necessary. (It is to be borne in\n\t\t\t\tmind that the term al-kitab refers here - as in many\n\t\t\t\tother places in the Qur\u0027an - not to any particular\n\t\t\t\tscripture but to divine revelation as such.) This\n\t\t\t\tinterpretation of the above Qur\u0027anic passage is supported\n\t\t\t\tby the fact that the famous Companion \u0027Abd Allah ibn\n\t\t\t\tMas\u0027ud used to read it thus: \"All mankind were once one\n\t\t\t\tsingle community, and then they began to differ\n\t\t\t\t(fakhtalafu) - whereupon God raised up...\", etc. Although\n\t\t\t\tthe word fakhtalafu interpolated here by Ibn Mas\u0027ud does\n\t\t\t\tnot appear in the generally-accepted text of the Qur\u0027an,\n\t\t\t\talmost all of the authorities are of the opinion that it\n\t\t\t\tis implied in the context."

There exist a\n\t\t\t\tnumber of highly-authenticated Traditions to the effect\n\t\t\t\tthat the wife of Thabit ibn Qays, Jamilah, came to the\n\t\t\t\tProphet and demanded a divorce from her husband on the\n\t\t\t\tground that, in spite of his irreproachable character and\n\t\t\t\tbehaviour, she \"disliked him as she would dislike falling\n\t\t\t\tinto unbelief after having accepted Islam\". Thereupon the\n\t\t\t\tProphet ordained that she should return to Thabit the\n\t\t\t\tgarden which he has given her as her dower (mahr) at the\n\t\t\t\ttime of their wedding, and decreed that the marriage\n\t\t\t\tshould be dissolved. (Several variants of this Tradition\n\t\t\t\thave been recorded by Bukhari, Nasa\u0027i, Tirmidhi, Ibn\n\t\t\t\tMajah and Bayhaqi, on the authority of Ibn \u0027Abbas.)\n\t\t\t\tSimilar Traditions, handed down on the authority of\n\t\t\t\t\u0027A\u0027ishah and relating to a woman called Hubaybah bint\n\t\t\t\tSahl, are to be found in the Muwatta\u0027 of Imam Malik, in\n\t\t\t\tthe Musnad of Imam Ahmad, and in the compilations of\n\t\t\t\tNasa\u0027i and Abu Da\u0027ud (in one variant, the latter gives\n\t\t\t\tthe woman\u0027s name as Hafsah bint Sahl). In accordance with\n\t\t\t\tthese Traditions, Islamic Law stipulates that whenever a\n\t\t\t\tmarriage is dissolved at the wife\u0027s instance without any\n\t\t\t\toffence on the part of the husband against his marital\n\t\t\t\tobligations, the wife is the contract-breaking party and\n\t\t\t\tmust, therefore, return the dower which she received from\n\t\t\t\thim at the time of concluding the marriage: and in this\n\t\t\t\tevent \"there shall be no sin upon either of them\" if the\n\t\t\t\thusband takes back the dower which the wife gives up of\n\t\t\t\ther own free will. An exhaustive discussion of all these\n\t\t\t\tTraditions and their legal implications is found in Nayl\n\t\t\t\tal-Awtar VII, pp. 34-41. For a summary of the relevant\n\t\t\t\tviews of the various schools of Islamic jurisprudence,\n\t\t\t\tsee Bidayat al-Mujtahid II, pp. 54-57."

Thus, for instance,\n\t\t\t\tMujahid and \u0027Ata\u0027 assume that \"that which is between\n\t\t\t\ttheir hands\" means \"that which has happened to them in\n\t\t\t\tthis world\", while \"that which is behind them\" is an\n\t\t\t\tallusion to \"that which will happen to them in the next\n\t\t\t\tworld\"; Ad-Dahhak and Al-Kalbi, on the other hand, assume\n\t\t\t\tthe exact opposite and say that \"that which is between\n\t\t\t\ttheir hands\" refers to the next world, \"because they are\n\t\t\t\tgoing towards it\", while \"that which is behind them\"\n\t\t\t\tmeans this world, \"because they are leaving it behind\"\n\t\t\t\t(Razi). Another explanation is \"that which took place\n\t\t\t\tbefore them and that which will take place after them\"\n\t\t\t\t(Zamakhshari).

It\n\t\t\t\tappears that in the early days after his migration to\n\t\t\t\tMedina, the Prophet - faced by the great poverty\n\t\t\t\tprevalent among his own community - advised his\n\t\t\t\tCompanions that \"charity should be bestowed only on the\n\t\t\t\tfollowers of Islam\" - a view that was immediately\n\t\t\t\tcorrected by the revelation of the above verse (a number\n\t\t\t\tof Traditions to this effect are quoted by Tabari, Razi\n\t\t\t\tand Ibn Kathir, as well as in Manar III, 82 f.).\n\t\t\t\tAccording to several other Traditions (recorded, among\n\t\t\t\tothers, by Nasa\u0027i and Abu Da\u0027ud and quoted by all the\n\t\t\t\tclassical commentators), the Prophet thereupon explicitly\n\t\t\t\tenjoined upon his followers to disburse charities upon\n\t\t\t\tall who needed them, irrespective of the faith of the\n\t\t\t\tperson concerned. Consequently, there is full agreement\n\t\t\t\tamong all the commentators that the above verse of the\n\t\t\t\tQur\u0027an - although expressed in the singular and, on the\n\t\t\t\tface of it, addressed to the Prophet - lays down an\n\t\t\t\tinjunction binding upon all Muslims. Razi, in particular,\n\t\t\t\tdraws from it the additional conclusion that charity - or\n\t\t\t\tthe threat to withhold it - must never become a means of\n\t\t\t\tattracting unbelievers to Islam: for, in order to be\n\t\t\t\tvalid, faith must be an outcome of inner conviction and\n\t\t\t\tfree choice. This is in consonance with verse {256} of\n\t\t\t\tthis surah: \"There shall be no coercion in matters of\n\t\t\t\tfaith.\""
