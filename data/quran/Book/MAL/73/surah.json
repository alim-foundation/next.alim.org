He knows that you will not be able to keep it\n\t\t\tup, so He has turned to you in Mercy, therefore, read from the\n\t\t\tQur\u0027an as much as you easily can. He knows that there may be some\n\t\t\tsick people among you, and some others who travel through the\n\t\t\tland to seek Allah\u0027s bounty; and yet some others fighting for the\n\t\t\tcause of Allah. Therefore, read as much of the Qur\u0027an as you\n\t\t\teasily can. Establish the Salah (five time daily prayers) and pay\n\t\t\tthe Zakah (poor due), and give to Allah a goodly loan. Whatever\n\t\t\tgood you will send forth for yourselves, you will find it with\n\t\t\tAllah, which will be much better and greater in reward. Seek\n\t\t\tAllah\u0027s forgiveness, surely Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most\n\t\t\tMerciful."
