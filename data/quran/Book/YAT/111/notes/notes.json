        "Body":  "The Arabic words \"Rahman\" and \"Rahim\" translated \"Most\n\t\t\t\tGracious\" and \"Most Merciful\" are both intensive forms\n\t\t\t\treferring to different aspects of God\u0027s attribute of\n\t\t\t\tMercy.\tThe Arabic intensive is more suited to express\n\t\t\t\tGod\u0027s attributes than the superlative degree in English. \n\t\t\t\tThe latter implies a comparison with other beings, or\n\t\t\t\twith other times or places, while there is no being like\n\t\t\t\tunto God, and He is independent of Time and Place.  Mercy\n\t\t\t\tmay imply pity, long-suffering, patience, and\n\t\t\t\tforgiveness, all of which the sinner needs and God Most\n\t\t\t\tMerciful bestows in abundant measure.  But there is a\n\t\t\t\tMercy that goes before even the need arises, the Grace\n\t\t\t\twhich is ever watchful, and flows from God Most Gracious\n\t\t\t\tto all His creatures, protecting the, preserving them,\n\t\t\t\tguiding them, and leading them to clearer light and\n\t\t\t\thigher life.  For this reason the attribute Rahman (Most\n\t\t\t\tGracious) is not applied to any but God, but the\n\t\t\t\tattribute Rahim (Merciful), is a general term, and may\n\t\t\t\talso be applied to Men.  To make us contemplate these\n\t\t\t\tboundless gifts of God, the formula:  \"In the name of God\n\t\t\t\tMost Gracious, Most Merciful\": is placed before every\n\t\t\t\tSura of the Qur-an (except the ninth), and repeated at\n\t\t\t\tthe beginning of every act by the Muslim who dedicates\n\t\t\t\this life to God, and whose hope is in His Mercy."

We may imagine them without passion or\n\t\t\t\temotion, of which the highest flower is love.  If man was\n\t\t\t\tto be endued with emotions, those emotions would lead him\n\t\t\t\tto the highest and drag him to the lowest.  The power of\n\t\t\t\twill or choosing would have to go with them, in order\n\t\t\t\tthat man might steer his own bark.  This power of will\n\t\t\t\t(when used aright) gave him to some extent a mastery over\n\t\t\t\this own fortunes and over nature, thus bringing him\n\t\t\t\tnearer to the God-like nature which has supreme mastery\n\t\t\t\tand will. We may suppose the angels had no independent\n\t\t\t\twills of their own; their perfection in other ways\n\t\t\t\treflected God\u0027s perfection but could not raise them to\n\t\t\t\tthe dignity of vicegerency.  The perfect vicegerent is he\n\t\t\t\twho has the power of initiative himself, but whose\n\t\t\t\tindependent action always reflects perfectly the will of\n\t\t\t\this Principal.\tThe distinction is expressed by\n\t\t\t\tShakespeare (Sonnet 94) in those fine lines: \"They are\n\t\t\t\tthe lords and owners of their faces.  Others but stewards\n\t\t\t\tof their excellence.\"  The angels in their one-sidedness\n\t\t\t\tsaw only the mischief consequent on the misuse of the\n\t\t\t\temotional nature by man; perhaps they also, being without\n\t\t\t\temotions, did not understand the whole of God\u0027s nature,\n\t\t\t\twhich gives and asks for love.\tIn humility and true\n\t\t\t\tdevotion to God, they remonstrate; we must not imagine\n\t\t\t\tthe least tinge of jealousy, as they are without emotion.\n\t\t\t\t This mystery of love being above them, they are told\n\t\t\t\tthat they do not know and they acknowledge (in ii. 32\n\t\t\t\tbelow) not their fault (for there is no question of\n\t\t\t\tfault) but their imperfection of knowledge.  At the same\n\t\t\t\ttime, the matter is brought home to them when the actual\n\t\t\t\tcapacities of man are shown to them (ii. 31, 33)."

The whole passage is charged\n\t\t\t\twith mystic meaning.  The particular qualities or\n\t\t\t\tfeelings which were outside the nature of angels were put\n\t\t\t\tby God into the nature of man.\tMan was thus able to love\n\t\t\t\tand understand love, and thus plan and initiate, as\n\t\t\t\tbecomes the office of vicegerent.

The stories were accepted in Jewish\n\t\t\t\ttraditions, which are themselves based on certain\n\t\t\t\tsacrificial directions in the Old Testament.  The heifer\n\t\t\t\tstory of Jewish tradition is based on Num. xix. 1-10, in\n\t\t\t\twhich Moses and Aaron ordered the Israelites to sacrifice\n\t\t\t\ta red heifer without spot or blemish; her body was to be\n\t\t\t\tburnt and the ashes were to be kept for the purification\n\t\t\t\tof the congregation from sin.

Moses announced the sacrifice the the\n\t\t\t\tIsraelites, and they treated it as a jest. When Moses\n\t\t\t\tcontinued solemnly to ask fo the sacrifice, they put him\n\t\t\t\toff on one pretext and another, asking a number of\n\t\t\t\tquestions which they could have answered themeselves if\n\t\t\t\tthey had listened to Moses\u0027s directions.

When at last\n\t\t\t\tthey were driven into a corner, they made the sacrifice,\n\t\t\t\tbut the will was wanting, which would have made the\n\t\t\t\tsacrifice efficacious for purification from sin.

Applying this further to Jewish national\n\t\t\t\thistory, the argument is developed in the following\n\t\t\t\tverses that the Children of Israel played fast and loose\n\t\t\t\twith their own rites and traditions, but they ould not\n\t\t\t\tthus evade the consequences of their own sin."

When the Muslim\n\t\t\t\tcommunity began to grow stronger they pretended to be of\n\t\t\t\tthem, but really tried to keep back any knowledge of\n\t\t\t\ttheir own Scriptures from them, lest they should be\n\t\t\t\tbeaten by their own arguments.

That form was different as given\n\t\t\t\tto Moses and then to Jesus and then to Muhammad. Some\n\t\t\t\tcommentators apply it also to the Ayat of the Qur-an. \n\t\t\t\tThere is nothing derogatory in this if we believe in\n\t\t\t\tprogressive revelation.  In iii. 7 we are told distinctly\n\t\t\t\tabout the Qur-an, that some of its verses are basic or\n\t\t\t\tfundamental, and others are allegorical, and it is\n\t\t\t\tmischievous to treat the allegorical verses and follow\n\t\t\t\tthem (literally).  On the other hand, it is absurd to\n\t\t\t\ttreat such a verse as ii. 115 as if it were abrograted by\n\t\t\t\tii. 144 about the Qibla.  We turn to the Qibla, but we do\n\t\t\t\tnot believe that God is only in one place.  He is\n\t\t\t\teverywhere.  See second note to ii. 144."

        "NoteID":  120,
        "Body":  "The previous verse told us that everything in heaven and\n\t\t\t\tearth celebrates the glory of God.  Lest anyone should\n\t\t\t\tthink that the heavens and the earth were themselves\n\t\t\t\tprimeval and eternal, we are now told that they\n\t\t\t\tthemselves are creatures of God\u0027s will and design.  Cf\n\t\t\t\tvi. 102, where the word bada\u0027a is used as here for the\n\t\t\t\tcreation of the heavens and the earth, and khalaqa is\n\t\t\t\tused for the creation of all things.  Bada\u0027a goes back to\n\t\t\t\tthe very primal beginning, as far as we can conceive it. \n\t\t\t\tThe materialists might say that primeval matter was\n\t\t\t\teternal; other things, i.e., the forms and shapes as we\n\t\t\t\tsee them now, were called into being at some time or\n\t\t\t\tother, and will perish.  When they perish, they dissolve\n\t\t\t\tinto primeval matter again, which stands as the base of\n\t\t\t\tall existence. We go further back.  We say that if we\n\t\t\t\tpostulate such primeval matter, it owes its origin itself\n\t\t\t\tto God\tWho is the final basis of existence, the Cause of\n\t\t\t\tall Causes.  If this is conceded, we proceed to argue\n\t\t\t\tthat the process of Creation is not then completed.  \"All\n\t\t\t\tthings in the heavens and on the earth\" are created by\n\t\t\t\tgradual processes.  In \"things\" we include abstract as\n\t\t\t\twell as material things.  We see the abstract things and\n\t\t\t\tideas actually growing before us.  But that also is God\u0027s\n\t\t\t\tcreation, to which we can apply the word khalaqa, for in\n\t\t\t\tit is involved the idea of measuring, fitting it into a\n\t\t\t\tscheme of other things. Cf. liv. 49; also xxv. 59.  Here\n\t\t\t\tcomes in what we know as the process of evolution.  On\n\t\t\t\tthe other hand, the \"amr\" (=Command, Direction, Design)\n\t\t\t\tis a single thing, unrelated to Time, \"like the twinkling\n\t\t\t\tof an eye\" (liv. 50). Another word to note in this\n\t\t\t\tconnection is ja\u0027ala \"making\" which seems to imply new\n\t\t\t\tshapes and forms, new dispositions, as the making of the\n\t\t\t\tSigns of the Zodiac in the heavens, or the setting out of\n\t\t\t\tthe sun and moon for light, or the establishment of the\n\t\t\t\tsuccession of day and night (xxv 61-62).  A further\n\t\t\t\tprocess with regard to the soul is described in the word\n\t\t\t\tsawwa, bringing it to perfection (xci. 7) but this we\n\t\t\t\tshall discuss in its place.  Fatara (xlii. 11) implies,\n\t\t\t\tlike bada\u0027a, the creating of a thing out of nothing and\n\t\t\t\tafter no preexisting similitude, but perhaps fatara\n\t\t\t\timplies the creation of primeval matter to which further\n\t\t\t\tprocesses have to be applied later, as when one prepares\n\t\t\t\tdough but leaves the leavining to be done after.  Badaa\n\t\t\t\t(without the \u0027ain), xxx. 27, implies beginning the\n\t\t\t\tprocess of creation; this is made further clear in xxxii.\n\t\t\t\t7 where the beginning of the creation of pristine man\n\t\t\t\tfrom clay refers to his physical body, leaving the\n\t\t\t\tfurther processes of reproduction and the breathing in of\n\t\t\t\tthe soul to be described in subsequent verses.\tLastly,\n\t\t\t\tbaraa is creation implying liberation from pre-existing\n\t\t\t\tmatter or circumstance, e.g, man\u0027s body from clay (lix.\n\t\t\t\t24) or a calamity from previously existing circumstances\n\t\t\t\t(lvii. 22).  See also vi. 94, n. 916; vi. 98, n. 923;\n\t\t\t\tlix. 24, nn. 5405-6."

But\n\t\t\t\tthere was no universal Qibla among them.  Some Jews\n\t\t\t\tturned towards Jerusalem, especially during the\n\t\t\t\tCaptivity, as we shall see later.  At the time of our\n\t\t\t\tProphet, Jerusalem was in the hands of the Byzantine\n\t\t\t\tEmpire, which was Christian.  But the Christians oriented\n\t\t\t\ttheir churches to the East (hence the word \"orientation\")\n\t\t\t\twhich is a point of the compass, and not the direction of\n\t\t\t\tany sacred place.  The fact of the altar being in the\n\t\t\t\tEast does not mean that every worshipper has his face to\n\t\t\t\tthe east; for, according at least to modern practice, the\n\t\t\t\tseats in a church are so placed that different\n\t\t\t\tworshippers may face in different directions.  The\n\t\t\t\tPreacher of Unity naturally wanted, in this as in other\n\t\t\t\tmatters, a symbol of complete unity, and his heart was\n\t\t\t\tnaturally delighted when the Qibla towards the Ka\u0027ba was\n\t\t\t\tsettled.  Its connection with Abraham gave it great\n\t\t\t\tantiquity; its character of being an Arab centre made it\n\t\t\t\tappropriate when the Message came in Arabic, and was\n\t\t\t\tpreached through the union of the Arabs; at the time it\n\t\t\t\twas adopted, the little Muslim community was shut out of\n\t\t\t\tit, being exiles in Medina, but it became a symbol of\n\t\t\t\thope and eventual triumph, of which Muhammad lived to see\n\t\t\t\tthe fulfilment; and it also became the centre and\n\t\t\t\tgathering ground of all peoples in the universal\n\t\t\t\tpilgrimage, which was instituted with it."

The lesson is that the\n\t\t\t\tmost sacred things may be turned to the basest uses; that\n\t\t\t\twe are not therefore necessarily to ban a thing misused;\n\t\t\t\tthat if our intentions and life are pure, God will\n\t\t\t\trecognise them even if the world cast stones at us\n\t\t\t\tbecause of some evil associations which they join with\n\t\t\t\twhat we do, or with the people we associate with, or with\n\t\t\t\tthe places which claim our reverence."

For example, amongst kin there are\n\t\t\t\tpersons, e.g., an orphan grandson in the presence of\n\t\t\t\tsurviving sons) who would not inherit under the intestate\n\t\t\t\tscheme, and the testator might like to provide for them. \n\t\t\t\tAgain, there may be outsiders for whom he may wish to\n\t\t\t\tprovide, and jurists have held that he has powers of\n\t\t\t\tdisposition up to one-third of his property.  But he must\n\t\t\t\tnot be partial to one heir at the expense of another, or\n\t\t\t\tattempt to defeat lawful creditors.  If he tries to do\n\t\t\t\tthis, those who are witnesses to his oral disposition may\n\t\t\t\tinterfere in two ways. One way would be to persuade the\n\t\t\t\ttestator to change his bequest before he dies. The other\n\t\t\t\tway would be after death, to get the interested parties\n\t\t\t\ttogether and ask them to agree to a more equitable\n\t\t\t\tarrangement.  In such a case they are acting in good\n\t\t\t\tfaith, and there is no fraud.  They are doing nothing\n\t\t\t\twrong.

The putting on of the\n\t\t\t\tpilgrim garb (ihram) is symbolical of his renouncing the\n\t\t\t\tvanities of the world.\tAfter this and until the end of\n\t\t\t\tthe pilgrimage he must not wear other clothes, or\n\t\t\t\tornaments, anoint his hair, use perfumes, hunt, or do\n\t\t\t\tother prohibited acts. The completion of the pilgrimage\n\t\t\t\tis symbolised by the shaving of the head for men, and the\n\t\t\t\tcutting off of a few locks of the hair of the head for\n\t\t\t\twomen, the putting off of the ihram and the resumption of\n\t\t\t\tthe ordinary dress."

The chief\n\t\t\t\trites may be briefly enumerated: (1) the wearing of the\n\t\t\t\tpilgrim garment (ihram) from certain points definitely\n\t\t\t\tfixed on all the roads to Mecca; after this the\n\t\t\t\tpilgrimage prohibitions come into operation and the\n\t\t\t\tpilgrim is dedicated to worship and prayer and the denial\n\t\t\t\tof vanities: (2) the going round the Ka\u0027ba seven times\n\t\t\t\t(tawaf), typifying activity, with the kissing of the\n\t\t\t\tlittle Black Stone built into the wall, the symbol of\n\t\t\t\tconcentration in the love of God; (3) After a short\n\t\t\t\tprayer at the Station of Abraham (Q. ii. 125), the\n\t\t\t\tpilgrim goes to the hills Safa and Marwa (Q. ii. 158),\n\t\t\t\tthe symbols of patience and perserverance; (4) the great\n\t\t\t\tSermon (Khutba) on the 7th of Zul-hijja, when the whole\n\t\t\t\tassembly listens to an exposition of the meaning of Hajj;\n\t\t\t\t(5) the visit on the eighth, of the whole body of\n\t\t\t\tpilgrims to the Valley of Mina (about six miles north of\n\t\t\t\tMecca), where the pilgrims halt and stay the night,\n\t\t\t\tproceeding on the ninth to the plain and hill of Arafat,\n\t\t\t\tabout five miles further north, which commemorates the\n\t\t\t\treunion of Adam and Eve after their wanderings, and is\n\t\t\t\talso called the Mount of Mercy; (6) the tenth day, the Id\n\t\t\t\tDay, the day of Sacrifice, when the sacrifice is offered\n\t\t\t\tin the Valley of Mina, and the symbolic ceremony of\n\t\t\t\tcasting seven stones at the Evil One is performed on the\n\t\t\t\tfirst occasion; it is continued on subsequent days; both\n\t\t\t\trites are connected with the story of Abraham; this is\n\t\t\t\tthe Id-ul-Adhha; note that the ceremony is symbolically\n\t\t\t\tconnected with the rejection of evil in thought, word,\n\t\t\t\tand deed.  This closes the Pilgrimage, but a stay of two\n\t\t\t\tor three days after this is recommended, and this is\n\t\t\t\tcalled Tashriq."

But wisdom is rare, and it is only wisdom that\n\t\t\t\tcan appreciate true well-being and distinguish it from\n\t\t\t\tthe false appearance of well-being."

The design of the Makkans was to gather\n\t\t\t\tall the resources they could, and with an overwhelming\n\t\t\t\tforce, to crush and annihilate Muhammad and his party. To\n\t\t\t\tthis end Abu Sufyan was leading a richly-laden caravan\n\t\t\t\tfrom Syria to Makkah. He called for armed aid from\n\t\t\t\tMakkah, The battle was fought in the plain of Badr, about\n\t\t\t\t150 kilometers south-west of Madinah. The Muslim force\n\t\t\t\tconsisted of only about 313 men, mostly ill-armed, but\n\t\t\t\tthey were led by Muhammad, and they were fighting for\n\t\t\t\ttheir Faith.

Their mettle and the wisdom and\n\t\t\t\tstrength of their Leader were shown in the battle of Badr\n\t\t\t\t(iii. 13 and note), in which the Makkan Pagans suffered a\n\t\t\t\tcrushing defeat. The Makkans were determined to wipe off\n\t\t\t\ttheir disgrace and to annihilate the Muslims in Madinah.\n\t\t\t\tTo this end they collected a large force and marched to\n\t\t\t\tMadinah. They numbered some 3,000 fighting men under Abu\n\t\t\t\tSufyan, and they were so confident of victory that their\n\t\t\t\twomen-folk came with them, and showed the most shameful\n\t\t\t\tsavagery after the battle. To meet the threatened danger\n\t\t\t\tthe Messenger of Allah, Muhammad Al-Mustafa, with his\n\t\t\t\tusual foresight, courage, and initiative, resolved to\n\t\t\t\ttake his station at the foot of Mount Uhud, which\n\t\t\t\tdominates the city of Madinah some three miles to the\n\t\t\t\tnorth. Early in the morning, on the 7th of Shawwal, A.H.\n\t\t\t\t3 (January, 625), he made his dispositions for battle.\n\t\t\t\tMadinah winters are notoriously rigorous, but the\n\t\t\t\twarriors of Islam (700 to 1000 in number) were up early.\n\t\t\t\tA torrent bed was to their south, and the passes in the\n\t\t\t\thills at their back were filled with 50 archers to\n\t\t\t\tprevent the enemy attack from the rear. The enemy were\n\t\t\t\tset the task of attacking the walls of Madinah, with the\n\t\t\t\tMuslims at their rear. In the beginning the battle went\n\t\t\t\twell for the Muslims. The enemy wavered, but the Muslim\n\t\t\t\tarchers, in disobedience of their orders, left their\n\t\t\t\tposts to join in the pursuit and share in the booty.\n\t\t\t\tThere was also treachery on the part of the 300\n\t\t\t\t\"Hypocrites\" led by Abdullah ibn Ubai, who deserted. The\n\t\t\t\tenemy took advantage of the opening left by the archers,\n\t\t\t\tand there was severe hand-to-hand fighting, in which\n\t\t\t\tnumbers told in favour of the enemy. Many of the\n\t\t\t\tCompanions and Helpers were killed. But there was no\n\t\t\t\trout. Among the Muslim martyrs was the gallant Hamza, a\n\t\t\t\tbrother of the Prophet\u0027s father. The graves of the\n\t\t\t\tmartyrs are still shown at Uhud. The Messenger himself\n\t\t\t\twas wounded in his head and face, and one of his front\n\t\t\t\tteeth was broken. Had it not been for his firmness,\n\t\t\t\tcourage, and coolness, all would have been lost. As it\n\t\t\t\twas, the prophet, in spite of his wound, and many of the\n\t\t\t\twounded Muslims, inspired by his example, returned to the\n\t\t\t\tfield next day, and Abu Sufyan and his Makkan army\n\t\t\t\tthought it most prudent to withdraw. Madinah was saved,\n\t\t\t\tbut a lesson in faith, constancy, firmness, and\n\t\t\t\tsteadfastness was learnt by the Muslims."

(4) in Allah\u0027s eyes there are various\n\t\t\t\tgrades of men, and we must try to understand and\n\t\t\t\tappreciate such grades. If we trust our Leader, we shall\n\t\t\t\tnot question his honesty without cause. If he is\n\t\t\t\tdishonest, he is not fit to be a leader."

(2) The word Zubur\n\t\t\t\thas been translated as scriptures. It comes from the root\n\t\t\t\tZabara which implies something hard. The commentators are\n\t\t\t\tnot agreed, but the prophetic writings which seemed to\n\t\t\t\tcontemporaries difficult to understand may well be meant\n\t\t\t\there. David\u0027s psalms (Zabur, iv. 163) may also come under\n\t\t\t\tthis description.

(2) In ii. 188 the same phrase occurred, to\n\t\t\t\tcaution us against greed. Here it occurs, to encourage us\n\t\t\t\tto increase property by economic use (traffic and trade),\n\t\t\t\trecalling Christ\u0027s parable of the Talents (Matt. xxv.\n\t\t\t\t14-30), where the servants who had increased their\n\t\t\t\tmaster\u0027s wealth were promoted and the servant who had\n\t\t\t\thoarded was cast into darkness. (3) We are warned that\n\t\t\t\tour waste may mean our own destruction (\"nor kill or\n\t\t\t\tdestroy yourselves.\") But there is a more general meaning\n\t\t\t\talso: we must be careful of our own and other people\u0027s\n\t\t\t\tlives.

This is the opposite\n\t\t\t\tof \"trade and traffic by mutual good-will.\" (4) Our\n\t\t\t\tviolence to our own brethren is particularly\n\t\t\t\tpreposterous, seeing that Allah has loved and showered\n\t\t\t\tHis mercies on us and all His creatures."

There was no guilty\n\t\t\t\tintention: therefore there was no murder. But all the\n\t\t\t\tsame, the family of the deceased was entitled to\n\t\t\t\tcompensation unless they freely remitted it, and in\n\t\t\t\taddition it was provided that the unfortunate man who\n\t\t\t\tmade the mistake should free a believing slave. Thus a\n\t\t\t\tdeplorable mistake was made the occasion for winning the\n\t\t\t\tliberty of a slave who was a Believer, for Islam\n\t\t\t\tdiscountenances slavery. The compensation could only be\n\t\t\t\tpaid if the deceased belonged to a Muslim society or to\n\t\t\t\tsome people at peace with the Muslim society.

He was suspected of having stolen a set of armour,\n\t\t\t\tand when the trial was hot, he planted the stolen\n\t\t\t\tproperty into the house of a Jew, where it was found. The\n\t\t\t\tJew denied the charge and accused Taima, but the\n\t\t\t\tsympathies of the Muslim community were with Taima on\n\t\t\t\taccount of his nominal profession of Islam. The case was\n\t\t\t\tbrought to the Prophet, who acquitted the Jew according\n\t\t\t\tto the strict principle of justice, as \"guided by Allah.\"\n\t\t\t\tAttempts were made to prejudice him and deceive him into\n\t\t\t\tusing his authority to favour Taima. When Taima realized\n\t\t\t\tthat his punishment was imminent he fled and turned\n\t\t\t\tapostate. The general lesson is that the righteous man is\n\t\t\t\tfaced with all sorts of subtle wiles; the wicked will try\n\t\t\t\tto appeal to his highest sympathies and most honourable\n\t\t\t\tmotives to deceive him and use him as an instrument for\n\t\t\t\tdefeating justice. He should be careful and cautious, and\n\t\t\t\tseek the help of Allah for protection against deception\n\t\t\t\tand for firmness in dealing the strictest justice without\n\t\t\t\tfear or favour. To do otherwise is to betray a sacred\n\t\t\t\ttrust; the trustee must defeat all attempts made to\n\t\t\t\tmislead him."

It is not profitable to discuss the many doubts\n\t\t\t\tand conjectures among the early Christian sects and among\n\t\t\t\tMuslim theologians. The Orthodox Christian Churches make\n\t\t\t\tit a cardinal point of their doctrine that his life was\n\t\t\t\ttaken on the Cross, that he died and was buried, that on\n\t\t\t\tthe third day he rose in the body with his wounds intact,\n\t\t\t\tand walked about and conversed, and ate with his\n\t\t\t\tdisciples, and was afterwards taken up bodily to heaven.\n\t\t\t\tThis is necessary for the theological doctrine of blood\n\t\t\t\tsacrifice and vicarious atonement for sins, which is\n\t\t\t\trejected by Islam. But some of the early Christian sects\n\t\t\t\tdid not believe that Christ was killed on the Cross. The\n\t\t\t\tBasilidans believed that some one else was substituted\n\t\t\t\tfor him. The Docetae held that Christ never had a real\n\t\t\t\tphysical or natural body, but only an apparent or phantom\n\t\t\t\tbody, and that his Crucifixion was only apparent, not\n\t\t\t\treal. The Marcionite Gospel (about A.D. 138) denied that\n\t\t\t\tJesus was born, and merely said that he appeared in human\n\t\t\t\tform. The Gospel of St. Barnabas supported the theory of\n\t\t\t\tsubstitution on the Cross. The Quranic teaching is that\n\t\t\t\tChrist was not crucified nor killed by the Jews,\n\t\t\t\tnotwithstanding certain apparent circumstances which\n\t\t\t\tproduced that illusion in the minds of some of his\n\t\t\t\tenemies: that disputations, doubts, and conjectures on\n\t\t\t\tsuch matters are vain; and that he was taken up to Allah\n\t\t\t\t(see next verse and note)."

We shall call such a\n\t\t\t\tperson A, who may be either a male or a female. In iv. 12\n\t\t\t\t(second half), A\u0027s case was considered where he had left\n\t\t\t\tuterine brothers or sisters. Here A\u0027s case is considered\n\t\t\t\twhere he has left brothers and or sisters by the father\u0027s\n\t\t\t\tside, whether the mother was the same or not. \"Brothers\"\n\t\t\t\tand \"sisters\" in this verse must be construed to be such\n\t\t\t\tbrothers and sisters. For the sake of clearness, I have\n\t\t\t\texpanded the terse language of the original in the\n\t\t\t\ttranslation. Let me explain it more concretely in this\n\t\t\t\tnote. A, and \"brother\" and \"sister\" being strictly\n\t\t\t\tdefined as above, we proceed to consider how A\u0027s\n\t\t\t\tinheritance would be divided. If A left a widow or\n\t\t\t\twidower, the widow\u0027s or widower\u0027s share would first be\n\t\t\t\tcalculated as in the first half of iv. 12; if A left no\n\t\t\t\tspouse, this calculation would not be necessary. Then if\n\t\t\t\tA left a single \"sister,\" she would have a half share,\n\t\t\t\tthe remaining half (in so for as it, or a part of it,\n\t\t\t\tdoes not fall to a spouse, if any) going to remoter\n\t\t\t\theirs: if a single \"brother,\" he would have the whole\n\t\t\t\t(subject to the spouse\u0027s right if there is a spouse); if\n\t\t\t\tmore than one \"brother,\" they divide the whole (subject\n\t\t\t\tto etc.). If A left two or more \"sisters,\" they get\n\t\t\t\tbetween them two-thirds, subject to the spouse\u0027s right,\n\t\t\t\tif any. If A left a \"brother\" and \"sister,\" or \"brothers\"\n\t\t\t\tand \"sisters,\" they divide on the basis that each\n\t\t\t\t\"brother\u0027s\" share is twice that of the \"sister\" (subject\n\t\t\t\tto, etc.).

The\n\t\t\t\tparticular meaning refers to the solemn Pledge and\n\t\t\t\tCovenant taken by two groups of people at \u0027Aqaba, a\n\t\t\t\tvalley near Mina, the first about fourteen months before\n\t\t\t\tthe Hijra, and the second a little later. These were\n\t\t\t\tPledges of fealty to the Messenger of Allah, comparable\n\t\t\t\tto the Covenant under Mount Sinai taken in the time of\n\t\t\t\tMoses (See 0. ii. 63 and n. 78). The general meaning has\n\t\t\t\tbeen explained in n. 682 to v. 1: man is under a\n\t\t\t\tspiritual obligation under an implied Covenant with\n\t\t\t\tAllah: Allah has given man reason, judgment, the higher\n\t\t\t\tfaculties of the soul, and even the position of\n\t\t\t\tvicegerent on earth (ii. 30), and man is bound to serve\n\t\t\t\tAllah faithfully-and obey His Will. That obedience begins\n\t\t\t\twith cleanliness in bodily functions, food, etc. It goes\n\t\t\t\ton to cleanliness of mind and thought, and culminates in\n\t\t\t\tpurity of motives in the inmost recesses of his heart and\n\t\t\t\tsoul."

        "NoteID":  779,
        "Body":  "Here, as in Sura Al-Baqarah (ii. 62), the Qur-an\n\t\t\t\tunderscores the importance of true and genuine faith,\n\t\t\t\twhich is to be judged by a sincere belief in Allah and\n\t\t\t\tman\u0027s accountability to Him backed by a righteous conduct\n\t\t\t\trather than by mere forms or labels. At both the places\n\t\t\t\tit repudiates the false claims of the People of the Book\n\t\t\t\tthat they had a special relationship with Allah for they\n\t\t\t\twere the children of Abraham; that they were a chosen\n\t\t\t\tpeople with special privileges, and no matter what they\n\t\t\t\tdid, their high status would remain unaffected. Here this\n\t\t\t\tfalse notion is refuted and the People of the Book are\n\t\t\t\tbeing reminded that it is through sincere belief and\n\t\t\t\trighteous conduct rather than pretentious claims that man\n\t\t\t\tcan win his Lord\u0027s pleasure and achieve ultimate success.\n\t\t\t\tThe verse does not purport to lay down an exhaustive list\n\t\t\t\tof the articles of faith. Nor does it seek to spell out\n\t\t\t\tthe essentials of a genuine belief in Allah, which has no\n\t\t\t\tmeaning unless it is accompanied by belief in His\n\t\t\t\tProphets for it is through their agency alone that we\n\t\t\t\tknow Allah\u0027s Will and can abide by it in our practical\n\t\t\t\tlives. This is especially true of His final Prophet,\n\t\t\t\tMuhammad (peace be on him) whose message is universal,\n\t\t\t\tand not confined to any particular group or section of\n\t\t\t\thumanity. Belief in the Prophethood of Muhammad (peace be\n\t\t\t\ton him) is thus an integral part and a logical corollary\n\t\t\t\tof belief in Allah. Moreover, it is also an essential\n\t\t\t\ttest of genuineness of such belief. This becomes clear\n\t\t\t\twhen the verse is read in conjunction with other relevant\n\t\t\t\tverses of the Qur-an. See, for instance, iv. 170, v. 15,\n\t\t\t\t19, vii. 157, 158, xxi. 107, xxv. I, xxxiii, 40, lxi. 6.\n\t\t\t\tSee also ii. 40, iii. 31-32, iv. 150-151."

The relation of such simple\n\t\t\t\tregulations as those of food, or game, or the reverence\n\t\t\t\tdue to a sacred place or sacred institution, has to be\n\t\t\t\texplained vis-a-vis man\u0027s higher duties. Baidhawi is\n\t\t\t\tright in classifying such duties under three heads; those\n\t\t\t\tdue to Allah, those due from a man to himself (his\n\t\t\t\tself-respect), and those due to other creatures of Allah.\n\t\t\t\tOr perhaps all duties have this threefold aspect. The\n\t\t\t\tfirst may be called Believing or Faith; the second,\n\t\t\t\tGuarding ourselves from evil, or Conscience: and the\n\t\t\t\tthird, doing good or Righteousness. But the simplest\n\t\t\t\tphysical rules, e.g., those about eating, cleanliness,\n\t\t\t\tetc., if they are good, refer also to the higher aspects.\n\t\t\t\tIf we eat bad food, we hurt ourselves, we cause offence\n\t\t\t\tto our neighbours, and we disobey Allah. If we have faith\n\t\t\t\tand righteousness, are we likely to be wanting in\n\t\t\t\tconscience? If we have conscience and faith, are we\n\t\t\t\tlikely to fail in righteousness? If we have conscience\n\t\t\t\tand righteousness, what can be their foundation but\n\t\t\t\tfaith? All three manifest themselves in a willing\n\t\t\t\tobedience to Allah, and love for Him. We realise His love\n\t\t\t\tin loving and doing good to His creatures, and our love\n\t\t\t\tfor Him is meaningless without such good."

And one of the Disciples (Judas) actually\n\t\t\t\tbetrayed Jesus. (2) Even in the Canonical Gospels, so\n\t\t\t\tmany of the miracles are concerned with food and drink,\n\t\t\t\te.g., the turning of the water into wine (John, ii,\n\t\t\t\t1-11); the conversion of five loaves and two small fishes\n\t\t\t\tinto food for 5,000 men (John vi. 5-13), this being the\n\t\t\t\tonly miracle recorded in all the four Gospels; the\n\t\t\t\tmiraculous number of fishes caught for food (Luke V.\n\t\t\t\t4-11); the cursing of the fig tree because it had no\n\t\t\t\tfruit (Matt. xxi. 18-19); the allegory of eating Christ\u0027s\n\t\t\t\tflesh and drinking his blood (John vi. 53-57). (3)\n\t\t\t\tBecause the Samaritans would not receive Jesus into their\n\t\t\t\tvillage, the Disciples James and John wanted a fire to\n\t\t\t\tcome down from heaven and consume them (Luke ix. 54)."

But in that passage\n\t\t\t\tand other similar passages, we are told that God\n\t\t\t\tcommanded the angels to bow down to Adam, and they obeyed\n\t\t\t\texcept Iblis. That implies that Iblis had been of the\n\t\t\t\tcompany of angels. In many passages Jinns and men are\n\t\t\t\tspoken of together. In lv. 14-15, man is stated to have\n\t\t\t\tbeen created from clay, while Jinns from a flame of fire.\n\t\t\t\tThe root meaning of junna, yujannu, is \"to be covered or\n\t\t\t\thidden,\" and janna yajunnu, in the active voice, \"to\n\t\t\t\tcover or hide,\" as in vi. 76. Some people say that jinn\n\t\t\t\ttherefore means the hidden qualities or capacities in\n\t\t\t\tman; others that it means wild or jungle folk hidden in\n\t\t\t\tthe hills or forests. I do not wish to be dogmatic, but I\n\t\t\t\tthink, from a collation and study of the Quranic\n\t\t\t\tpassages, that the meaning is simply \"a spirit,\" or an\n\t\t\t\tinvisible or hidden force.

They were cousins to the \u0027Ad, apparently a\n\t\t\t\tyounger branch of the same race. Their story also belongs\n\t\t\t\tto Arabian tradition, according to which their eponymous\n\t\t\t\tancestor Thamud was a son of \u0027Abir (a brother of Aram),\n\t\t\t\tthe son of Sam, the son of Noah. Their seat was in the\n\t\t\t\tnorth-west corner of Arabia (Arabia Petraea), between\n\t\t\t\tMadinah and Syria. It included both rocky country (hijr.\n\t\t\t\txv. 80), and the spacious fertile valley (Wadi) and\n\t\t\t\tplains country of Qura, which begins just north of the\n\t\t\t\tCity of Madinah and is traversed by the Hijaz Railway.\n\t\t\t\tWhen the holy Prophet in the 9th year of the Hijra led\n\t\t\t\this expedition to Tabuk (about 400 miles north of\n\t\t\t\tMadinah) against the Roman forces, on a reported Roman\n\t\t\t\tinvasion from Syria, he and his men came across the\n\t\t\t\tarchaeological remains of the Thamud. The recently\n\t\t\t\texcavated rock city of Petra, near Maan, may go back to\n\t\t\t\tthe Thamud, though its architecture has many features\n\t\t\t\tconnecting it with Egyptian and Graeco-Roman culture\n\t\t\t\toverlaying what is called by European writers Nabataean\n\t\t\t\tCulture. Who were the Nabataeans? They were an old Arab\n\t\t\t\ttribe which played a considerable part in history after\n\t\t\t\tthey came into conflict with Antigonus I in 312 B.C.\n\t\t\t\tTheir capital was Petra, but they extended their\n\t\t\t\tterritory right up to the Euphrates. In 85 B.C. they were\n\t\t\t\tlords of Damascus under their king Haritha (Aretas of\n\t\t\t\tRoman history). For some time they were allies of the\n\t\t\t\tRoman Empire and held the Red Sea littoral. The Emperor\n\t\t\t\tTrajan reduced them and annexed their territory in A.D.\n\t\t\t\t105. The Nabataeans succeeded the Thamud of Arabian\n\t\t\t\ttradition. The Thamud are mentioned by name in an\n\t\t\t\tinscription of the Assyrian King Sargon, dated 715 B.C.,\n\t\t\t\tas a people of Eastern and Central Arabia (Encyclopaedia\n\t\t\t\tof Islam). See also Appendix VII to S. xxvi. With the\n\t\t\t\tadvance of material civilisation, the Thamud people\n\t\t\t\tbecame godless and arrogant, and were destroyed by an\n\t\t\t\tearthquake. Their prophet and warner was Salih, and the\n\t\t\t\tcrisis in their history is connected with the story of a\n\t\t\t\twonderful she-camel: see next note."

Midian and the\n\t\t\t\tMidianites are frequently mentioned in the Old Testament,\n\t\t\t\tthough the particular incident here mentioned belongs to\n\t\t\t\tArab rather than to Jewish tradition. The Midianites were\n\t\t\t\tof Arab race, though, as neighbours of the Canaanites,\n\t\t\t\tthey probably intermixed with them. They were a wandering\n\t\t\t\ttribe: it was Midianite merchants to whom Joseph was sold\n\t\t\t\tinto slavery, and who took him to Egypt. Their principal\n\t\t\t\tterritory in the time of Moses was in the northeast of\n\t\t\t\tthe Sinai Peninsula, and east of the Amalekites. Under\n\t\t\t\tMoses the Israelites waged a war of extermination against\n\t\t\t\tthem: they slew the kings of Midian, slaughtered all the\n\t\t\t\tmales, burnt their cities and castles, and captured their\n\t\t\t\tcattle (Num. xxxi, 7-1 1). This sounds like total\n\t\t\t\textermination. Yet a few generations afterwards, they\n\t\t\t\twere so powerful that the Israelites for their sins were\n\t\t\t\tdelivered into the captivity of the Midianites for seven\n\t\t\t\tyears: both the Midianites and their camels were without\n\t\t\t\tnumber: and the Israelites hid from them in \"dens.....\n\t\t\t\tcaves, and strongholds\" (Judges vii. 1- 6). Gideon\n\t\t\t\tdestroyed them again, (Judges vii. 1-25), say about two\n\t\t\t\tcenturies after Moses. As the decisive battle was near\n\t\t\t\tthe hill of Moreh, not far south of Mount Tabor, we may\n\t\t\t\tlocalise the Midianites on this occasion in the northern\n\t\t\t\tparts of the Jordan valley, at least 200 miles north of\n\t\t\t\tthe Sinai Peninsula. This and the previous destruction\n\t\t\t\tunder Moses were local, and mention no town of Midian. In\n\t\t\t\tlater times there was a town of Madyan on the cast side\n\t\t\t\tof the Gulf of \u0027Aqaba. It is mentioned in Josephus,\n\t\t\t\tEusebius, and Ptolemy: (Encyclopaedia of Islam). Then it\n\t\t\t\tdisappears from geography. In Muslim times it was a\n\t\t\t\trevived town with quite a different kind of population,\n\t\t\t\tbut it never flourished. The Midianites disappeared from\n\t\t\t\thistory."

His identification with Jethro,\n\t\t\t\tthe father-in-law of Moses, has no warrant, and I reject\n\t\t\t\tit. There is no similarity either in names or incidents,\n\t\t\t\tand there are chronological difficulties (see n. 1064\n\t\t\t\tbelow). If, as the Commentators tell us, Shuaib was in\n\t\t\t\tthe fourth generation from Abraham, being a\n\t\t\t\tgreat-grandson of Madyan (a son of Abraham), he would be\n\t\t\t\tonly about a century from the time of Abraham, whereas\n\t\t\t\tthe Hebrew Bible would give us a period of four to six\n\t\t\t\tcenturies between Abraham and Moses. The mere fact that\n\t\t\t\tJathro was a Midianite and that another name, Hobab, is\n\t\t\t\tmentioned for a father-in-law of Moses in Num x. 29, is\n\t\t\t\tslender ground for identificaion. As the Midianites were\n\t\t\t\tmainly a nomad tribe, we need not be surprised that their\n\t\t\t\tdestruction in one or two settlements did not affect\n\t\t\t\ttheir life in wandering sections of the tribe in other\n\t\t\t\tgeographical regions. Shu\u0027aib\u0027s mission was apparently in\n\t\t\t\tone of the settled towns of the Midianites, which was\n\t\t\t\tcompletely destroyed by an earthquake (vii. 91). If this\n\t\t\t\thappened in the century after Abraham, there is no\n\t\t\t\tdifficulty in supposing that they were again a numerous\n\t\t\t\ttribe, three or five centuries later, in the time of\n\t\t\t\tMoses (see last note). As they were a mixed wandering\n\t\t\t\ttribe, both their resilience and their eventual\n\t\t\t\tabsorption can be easily understood. But the destruction\n\t\t\t\tof the settlement or settlements (if the Wood or Aika was\n\t\t\t\ta separate settlement, see n. 2000 to xv. 78) to which\n\t\t\t\tShu\u0027aib was sent to preach was complete, and no traces of\n\t\t\t\tit now remain. The name of the highest mountain of Yemen,\n\t\t\t\tNabi Shu\u0027aib (11,000 ft.) has probably no connection with\n\t\t\t\tthe geographical territory of the nomad Midianites,\n\t\t\t\tunless we suppose that their wanderings extended so far\n\t\t\t\tsouth from the territories mentioned in the last note."

The following\n\t\t\t\tconsiderations will help us in getting some idea of their\n\t\t\t\tperiod. (1) The stories of Noah, Hud, Salih, Lut, and\n\t\t\t\tShu\u0027aib seem to be in chronological order. Therefore\n\t\t\t\tShu\u0027aib came after Abraham, whose nephew Lut was. (2) If\n\t\t\t\tShu\u0027aib was in the fourth generation from Abraham, (see\n\t\t\t\tn. 1590 to xi. 80), it would be impossible for him to\n\t\t\t\thave been a contemporary of Moses, who came many\n\t\t\t\tcenturies later. This difficulty is recognised by Ibn\n\t\t\t\tKathir and other classical commentators. (3) The\n\t\t\t\tidentification of Shu\u0027aib with Jethro the father-in-law\n\t\t\t\tof Moses is without warrant; see n. 1054 (vii. 85). (4)\n\t\t\t\tShu\u0027aib must have been before Moses; see vii. 103. (5)\n\t\t\t\tThe Midianites who were destroyed by Moses and by Gideon\n\t\t\t\tafter him (n. 1053) were local remnants, as we may speak\n\t\t\t\tof the Jews at the present day; but their existence as a\n\t\t\t\tnation in their original home-lands seems to have ended\n\t\t\t\tbefore Moses: \"they became as if they had never been in\n\t\t\t\tthe homes where they had flourished\" (vii. 92). (6)\n\t\t\t\tJosephus, Eusebius, and Ptolemy mention a town of Madyan,\n\t\t\t\tbut it was not of any importance (n. 1053). (7) After the\n\t\t\t\tfirst centuries of the Christian era, Madyan as a town\n\t\t\t\tappears as an unimportant place resting on its past."

Times changed, and the racial bigotry of the\n\t\t\t\tEgyptians showed its head again, and Israel was\n\t\t\t\toppressed.

Humanity has been\n\t\t\t\tgiven by Allah certain powers and faculties, whose\n\t\t\t\tpossession creates on our side special spiritual\n\t\t\t\tobligations which we must faithfully discharge: see v. 1.\n\t\t\t\tand n. 682.

Men may betray the\n\t\t\t\ttrust of Allah and His Prophet by misusing property, or\n\t\t\t\tabusing the confidence reposed in them, or the knowledge\n\t\t\t\tor talents given to them. On that special occasion, when\n\t\t\t\tthe plans for the protection of Allah\u0027s worshippers\n\t\t\t\tagainst annihilation were of special importance, the\n\t\t\t\tProphet\u0027s trust and confidence had to be guarded with\n\t\t\t\tspecial care. Occasions for scrupulously respecting the\n\t\t\t\ttrust and confidence of our fellow-men occur every day in\n\t\t\t\tour life, and few of us can claim perfection in this\n\t\t\t\trespect. Hence the special distinction of the Prophet of\n\t\t\t\tAllah, who earned the title of Al-Amin, the one who was\n\t\t\t\ttrue to every trust reposed in him."

While the Holy Prophet was with them,\n\t\t\t\the-the Mercy of the Worlds-conferred a certain amount of\n\t\t\t\timmunity to them. There were also other Muslims, just men\n\t\t\t\twho asked for forgiveness. And Allah keeps the door of\n\t\t\t\trepentance and forgiveness open to all as long as they\n\t\t\t\tmake it possible. But let them not be puffed up with\n\t\t\t\tpride, or think that they have lasting immunity. What\n\t\t\t\tbecame of Abu Jahl? He and some of his greatest warriors\n\t\t\t\twere slain at Badr.

For brevity I have\n\t\t\t\tonly used \"maintain\" in the Translation. Before the\n\t\t\t\tpreaching of Islam the Pagans built, repaired, and\n\t\t\t\tmaintained the Mosque, and celebrated Pagan ceremonies in\n\t\t\t\tit. They made an income out of it. Islam protested, and\n\t\t\t\tthe Pagans ejected Muslims and their Leader from Makkah\n\t\t\t\tand shut them out from the Ka\u0027ba itself. When the Muslims\n\t\t\t\twere strong enough to re-take Makkah (A.H. 8), they\n\t\t\t\tpurified the Mosque and re-established the worship of the\n\t\t\t\ttrue God. If they became Muslims, it was a different\n\t\t\t\tmatter. The further question arose: should they be\n\t\t\t\tallowed to visit it and practise their unseemly Pagan\n\t\t\t\trites? Obviously this would be derogatory to the dignity\n\t\t\t\tand honour of the Mosque, and was forbidden. This was the\n\t\t\t\tparticular occasion to which the verse refers. The\n\t\t\t\tgeneral deduction is clear. A house of Allah is a place\n\t\t\t\tof sincere devotion, not a theatre for vulgar rites nor a\n\t\t\t\tsource of worldly income. Only sincere Believers have a\n\t\t\t\tright of entry. Who the sincere Believers are, is\n\t\t\t\texplained in the next verse."

The four Prohibited Months were:\n\t\t\t\tZul-qa\u0027dah, Zul- hijjah, Muharram, and Rajab. If it\n\t\t\t\tsuited them they postponed one of these months, and so a\n\t\t\t\tprohibited month became an ordinary month: while their\n\t\t\t\topponents might hesitate to fight, they got an undue\n\t\t\t\tadvantage. It also upset the security of the Month of\n\t\t\t\tPilgrimage. This very ancient usage made for fair dealing\n\t\t\t\tall round, and its infraction by the Pagans is condemned.\n\t\t\t\tThe question of a solar astronomical year as against the\n\t\t\t\tlunar Islamic year does not arise here. But it may be\n\t\t\t\tnoted that the Arab year was roughly luni solar like the\n\t\t\t\tHindu year, the months being lunar and the intercalation\n\t\t\t\tof a month every three years brought the year nearly but\n\t\t\t\tnot accurately up to the solar reckoning. From the year\n\t\t\t\tof the Farewell Pilgrimage (A.H.10) the Islamic year was\n\t\t\t\tdefinitely fixed as a purely lunar year of roughly 354\n\t\t\t\tdays, the months being calculated by the actual\n\t\t\t\tappearance of the moon. After that, every month of the\n\t\t\t\tIslamic year came about 11 days earlier in the solar\n\t\t\t\tyear, and thus the Islamic months travelled all round the\n\t\t\t\tseasons and the solar year."

The story of Jonah\n\t\t\t\tis told in xxxvii. 139-148, which would be an appropriate\n\t\t\t\tplace for further comments. Here it is sufficient to note\n\t\t\t\tthat Nineveth was a very ancient town which is now no\n\t\t\t\tlonger on the map. Its site is believed to be marked by\n\t\t\t\tthe two mounds on the left bank of the Tigris, opposite\n\t\t\t\tthe flourishing city of Mosul on the right bank, about\n\t\t\t\t230 miles north-north-west of Bagdad. One of the mounds\n\t\t\t\tbears the name of \"the Tomb of Nabi Yunus.\" Archeologists\n\t\t\t\thave not yet fully explored its antiquities. But it is\n\t\t\t\tclear that it was a very old Sumerian town, perhaps older\n\t\t\t\tthan 3500 B.C. It became the capital of Assyria. The\n\t\t\t\tfirst Assyrian Empire under Shalmaneser I, about 1300\n\t\t\t\tB.C., became the supreme power in Western Asia. Babylon,\n\t\t\t\twhose tributary Assyria had formerly been, now became\n\t\t\t\ttributary to Assyria. The second Assyrian Empire arose\n\t\t\t\tabout 745 B.C., and Sennacherib (705-681 B.C.) beautified\n\t\t\t\tthe town with many Public Works. It was destroyed by the\n\t\t\t\tScythians (so-called Medes) in 612 B.C. If the date of\n\t\t\t\tJonah were assumed to be about 800 B.C., it would be\n\t\t\t\tbetween the First and the Second Assyrian Empire; when\n\t\t\t\tthe City was nearly destroyed for its sins, but on\n\t\t\t\taccount of its repentance was given a new lease of\n\t\t\t\tglorious life in the Second Empire."

According\n\t\t\t\tto the chronology in the last note the new lease would be\n\t\t\t\tfor about two centuries, after which it perished\n\t\t\t\tcompletely for its sins and abominations.

As a\n\t\t\t\tcomplementary proposition, men of Faith must not be\n\t\t\t\timpatient or angry if they have to contend against\n\t\t\t\tUnfaith, and most important of all, they must guard\n\t\t\t\tagainst the temptation of forcing Faith, i.e., imposing\n\t\t\t\tit on others by physical compulsion.

This mountain system \"is unique\n\t\t\t\tin the Old World in containing great sheets of water that\n\t\t\t\tare bitter lakes without outlets, Lake Van and Lake\n\t\t\t\tUrumiya being the chief,\" (E.B., Asia). Such would be the\n\t\t\t\tvery region for a stupendous Deluge if the usual scanty\n\t\t\t\trainfall were to be changed into a very heavy downpour. A\n\t\t\t\tglacier damming of Lake Van in the Ice Age would have\n\t\t\t\tproduced the same result. The region has many local\n\t\t\t\ttraditions connected with Noah and the Flood. The\n\t\t\t\tBiblical legend of Mount Ararat being the resting place\n\t\t\t\tof Noah\u0027s Ark is hardly plausible, seeing that the\n\t\t\t\thighest peak of Ararat is over 16,000 feet high. If it\n\t\t\t\tmeans one of the lower-peaks of the Ararat system, it\n\t\t\t\tagrees with the Muslim tradition about Mount Judi (or\n\t\t\t\tGudi), and this is in accordance with the oldest and best\n\t\t\t\tlocal traditions. These traditions are accepted by\n\t\t\t\tJosephus, by the Nestorian Christians, and indeed by all\n\t\t\t\tthe Eastern Christians and Jews, and they are the best in\n\t\t\t\ttouch with local traditions. See (Viscount) J. Bryce,\n\t\t\t\t\"Transcaucasia and Ararat,\" 4th ed., 1896. p. 216."

Abraham had by this time passed through the\n\t\t\t\tfire of persecutions in the Mesopotamian valleys: he had\n\t\t\t\tleft behind him the ancestral idolatry of Ur of the\n\t\t\t\tChaldees; he had been tried and he had triumphed over the\n\t\t\t\tpersecution of Nimrud: he had now taken up his residence\n\t\t\t\tin Canaan, from which his newphew Lot (Lut) was called to\n\t\t\t\tpreach to the wicked Cities of the Plain east of the Dead\n\t\t\t\tsea which is itself called Bahr Lut. Thus prepared and\n\t\t\t\tsanctified, he was now ready to receive the Message that\n\t\t\t\the was chosen to be the progenitor of a great line of\n\t\t\t\tProphets, and that Message is now referred to. Can we\n\t\t\t\tlocalise Nimrud? If local tradition in place-names can be\n\t\t\t\trelied upon, this king must have ruled over the tract\n\t\t\t\twhich includes the modern Nimrud, on the Tigris, about\n\t\t\t\ttwenty miles south of Mosul. This is the site of Assyrian\n\t\t\t\truins of great interest, but the rise of Assyria as an\n\t\t\t\tEmpire was of course much later than the time of Abraham.\n\t\t\t\tThe Assyrian city was called Kalakh (or Calah), and\n\t\t\t\tarchaeological excavations carried out there have yielded\n\t\t\t\tvaluable results, which are however irrelevant for our\n\t\t\t\tCommentary. A) Abraham received the strangers with a\n\t\t\t\tsalutation of Peace, and immediately placed before them a\n\t\t\t\tsumptuous meal of roasted calf. The strangers were\n\t\t\t\tembarrassed. They were angels and did not eat. If\n\t\t\t\thospitality is refused, it means that those who refuse it\n\t\t\t\tmeditate no good to the would be host. Abraham therefore\n\t\t\t\thad a feeling of mistrust and fear in his mind, which the\n\t\t\t\tstrangers at once set at rest by saying that their\n\t\t\t\tmission was in the first place to help Lut as a warner to\n\t\t\t\tthe Cities of Plain. But in the second place they had\n\t\t\t\tgood news for Abraham; he was to be the father of great\n\t\t\t\tpeoples!"

His father was Jacob, also called Israel the son\n\t\t\t\tof Isaac, the younger son of Abraham, (the elder son\n\t\t\t\thaving been Isma\u0027il, whose story is told in ii. 124-129.\n\t\t\t\tAbraham may be called the Father of the line of Semitic\n\t\t\t\tprophecy. Jacob had four wives. From three of them he had\n\t\t\t\tten sons. In his old age he had from Rachel (Arabic\n\t\t\t\tRahil), a very beautiful woman, two sons Joseph and\n\t\t\t\tBenjamin (the youngest). The place where Jacob and his\n\t\t\t\tfamily and his flocks were located was in Canaan, and is\n\t\t\t\tshown by tradition near modern Nablus (ancient Shechem),\n\t\t\t\tsome thirty miles north of Jerusalem. The traditional\n\t\t\t\tsite of the well into which Joseph was thrown by his\n\t\t\t\tbrothers is still shown in the neighbourhood."

To\n\t\t\t\tsuppose that phenomenal events are the only reality is a\n\t\t\t\tmark of one-sided materialism. As Hamlet said to Horatio,\n\t\t\t\t\"there are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, than\n\t\t\t\tare dreamt of in your philosophy.\" External events have\n\t\t\t\ttheir own limited reality, but there are bigger realities\n\t\t\t\tbehind them, that sometimes appear darkly in the visions\n\t\t\t\tof ordinary men, but more clearly in the visions of\n\t\t\t\tpoets, seers, sages and prophets. Joseph had to be\n\t\t\t\ttrained in seeing the realities behind events and\n\t\t\t\tvisions. He was hated by his brothers and sold by them\n\t\t\t\tinto slavery; they were sending him into the land of\n\t\t\t\tEgypt, where he was to rule men. He loved his father\n\t\t\t\tdearly and was separated from him, and his mother had\n\t\t\t\tdied early; but his affection was not blunted, but drawn\n\t\t\t\tto a keener edge when his benevolent work benefited\n\t\t\t\tmillions in Egypt, and in the world. His own visions of\n\t\t\t\tstars, sun, and moon prostrating themselves before him,\n\t\t\t\twas no idle dream of a selfish fool, but the\n\t\t\t\tprefigurement of a power, which, used rightly, was to\n\t\t\t\tmake his own honour an instrument of service to millions\n\t\t\t\the had not seen, through men and women whose own power\n\t\t\t\tand dignity were sanctified through him. He was to\n\t\t\t\tunderstand the hidden meaning of what seemed futilities,\n\t\t\t\tblunderings, snares, evil-plottings, love gone wrong, and\n\t\t\t\tpower used tyrannically. He was to interpret truth to\n\t\t\t\tthose who would never have reached it otherwise."

And Joseph\u0027s\n\t\t\t\tlittle brother Benjamin, born of the same mother as\n\t\t\t\thimself; would the other ten brothers, not by the same\n\t\t\t\tmother, have any affection for him, or would they treat\n\t\t\t\thim, as they treated Joseph? How would the whole family\n\t\t\t\tbe in these hard times? A sort of answer came when the\n\t\t\t\tten selfish brothers, driven by famine, came from Canaan\n\t\t\t\tto buy corn. Joseph, though so great a man, kept the\n\t\t\t\tdetails of the famine department in his own hands,\n\t\t\t\totherwise there might have been waste. But to the public\n\t\t\t\the was a mighty Egyptian administrator, probably in\n\t\t\t\tEgyptian dress, and with all the paraphernalia of his\n\t\t\t\trank about him.

This interpretation has good authority\n\t\t\t\tbehind it, though there are differences of opinion."

So is the Good Word. It is\n\t\t\t\tas beautiful as it is true. It abides in all the changes\n\t\t\t\tand chances of this life, and even beyond (see verse 27\n\t\t\t\tbelow); it is never shaken by sorrow or what seems to us\n\t\t\t\tcalamity; its roots are deep down in the bed-rock facts\n\t\t\t\tof life.

Its fruit-the enjoyment of its blessings-is not\n\t\t\t\tconfined to one season or one set of circumstances;\n\t\t\t\tfurthermore the fortunate man who is the vehicle of that\n\t\t\t\tword has no self-pride; he attributes all its goodness,\n\t\t\t\tand his act in spreading it, to the Will and Leave of\n\t\t\t\tAllah.

There is no real difficulty in\n\t\t\t\taccepting this as part of a late Makkan Sura even without\n\t\t\t\tsupposing it to be a prophecy. The Makkan Pagans had\n\t\t\t\tturned Religion into a blasphemous superstition, and were\n\t\t\t\tmisguiding their people, persecuting the true Messenger\n\t\t\t\tof Allah and all who followed his teaching. Their cup of\n\t\t\t\tiniquity seemed about full, and they seemed to be heading\n\t\t\t\tto perdition, as later events indeed showed to be the\n\t\t\t\tcase. The general meaning is also clear. Selfish men,\n\t\t\t\twhen they seize power, want worship for themselves or\n\t\t\t\ttheir Phantasies, in derogation of the true God. Power,\n\t\t\t\twhich should have been an instrument of good, becomes in\n\t\t\t\ttheir hands an instrument of evil. They and their people\n\t\t\t\trush headlong to perdition. \"These be thy gods, 0\n\t\t\t\tIsrael!\" has been a cry repeated again and again in\n\t\t\t\thistory, in the face, or at the back, of men of God!"

It was instituted with the Law of Moses\n\t\t\t\tbecause of Israel\u0027s hardness of heart (ii. 74); for they\n\t\t\t\tconstantly disputed with their Prophet Moses (iii 108),\n\t\t\t\tand there were constantly among them afterwards men who\n\t\t\t\tbroke the Sabbath (ii. 65, and n. 79). (2) Which was the\n\t\t\t\ttrue Sabbath Day? The Jews observe Saturday. The\n\t\t\t\tChristians, who include the Old Testament in their\n\t\t\t\tinspired Scripture, observe Sunday, and a sect among them\n\t\t\t\t(the Seventh Day Adventists) disagree, and observe\n\t\t\t\tSaturday. So there is disagreement among the People of\n\t\t\t\tthe Book. Let them dispute among themselves. Their\n\t\t\t\tdispute will not be settled till the Day of Judgment.\n\t\t\t\tMeanwhile, Muslims are emancipated from such stringent\n\t\t\t\trestrictions. For them there is certainly the Day of\n\t\t\t\tUnited Prayer on Friday, but it is in no sense like the\n\t\t\t\tJewish or the Scotch Sabbath!"

His patience and self-restraint were under\n\t\t\t\tcircumstances of extraordinary provocation.

But when they actually choose evil, Allah in His\n\t\t\t\tinfinite Mercy delays their punishment and removes the\n\t\t\t\toccasion for their immediate self-destruction by\n\t\t\t\twithholding the Signs which might make them transgress\n\t\t\t\tall the more and compass their total destruction."

In the\n\t\t\t\treign of a Roman Emperor who persecuted the Christians,\n\t\t\t\tseven Christian youths of Ephesus left the town and hid\n\t\t\t\tthemselves in a cave in a mountain near by. They fell\n\t\t\t\tasleep, and remained asleep for some generations or\n\t\t\t\tcenturies. When the wall which sealed up the cave was\n\t\t\t\tbeing demolished, the youths awoke. They still thought of\n\t\t\t\tthe world in which they had previously lived. They had no\n\t\t\t\tidea of the duration of time. But when one of them went\n\t\t\t\tto the town to purchase provisions, he found that the\n\t\t\t\twhole world had changed. The Christian religion, instead\n\t\t\t\tof being persecuted was fashionable: in fact it was now\n\t\t\t\tthe State religion. His dress and speech, and the money\n\t\t\t\twhich he brought, seemed to belong to another world. This\n\t\t\t\tattracted attention. The great ones of the land visited\n\t\t\t\tthe Cave, and verified the tale by questioning the man\u0027s\n\t\t\t\tCompanions. When the story became very popular and\n\t\t\t\tcirculated throughout the Roman Empire, we may well\n\t\t\t\tsuppose that an Inscription was put up at the mouth of\n\t\t\t\tthe Cave. See verse 9 and n. 2336. This inscription was\n\t\t\t\tprobably to be seen for many years afterwards, as Ephesus\n\t\t\t\twas a famous city on the west coast of Asia Minor, about\n\t\t\t\tforty to fifty miles south of Smyrna. Later on, the\n\t\t\t\tKhalifa Wathiq (842-846 A.D.) sent an expedition to\n\t\t\t\texamine and identify the locality, as he did about the\n\t\t\t\tZul-Qarnain barrier in Central Asia. A popular story\n\t\t\t\tcirculating from mouth to mouth would necessarily be\n\t\t\t\tvague as to dates and vary very much in details.\n\t\t\t\tSomewhere about the 6th century A.D. a Syriac writer\n\t\t\t\treduced it to writing. He suggested that the youths were\n\t\t\t\tseven in number; that they went to sleep in the reign of\n\t\t\t\tthe Emperor Decius (who reigned from 249 to 251 A.D., and\n\t\t\t\twho was a violent persecutor of Christianity); and that\n\t\t\t\tthey awoke in the reign of Theodosius 11, who reigned\n\t\t\t\tfrom 408 to 450 A.D. In our literature Decius is known as\n\t\t\t\tDaqyanus (from the adjectival Latin from Decianus), and\n\t\t\t\tthe name stands as a symbol of injustice and oppression,\n\t\t\t\tand also of things old fashioned and out-of-date, as res\n\t\t\t\tDecianae must have been two or three centuries after\n\t\t\t\tDecius."

        "Body":  "This verse should be read with the next verse. In the\n\t\t\t\tfloating oral tradition the duration of time in the Cave\n\t\t\t\twas given differently in different versions. When the\n\t\t\t\ttradition was reduced to writing, some Christian writers\n\t\t\t\t(e.g., Simeon Metaphrastes) named 372 years, some less.\n\t\t\t\tIn round numbers 300 years in the solar Calendar would\n\t\t\t\tamount to 309 in the lunar Calendar. But the next verse\n\t\t\t\tpoints out that all these are mere conjectures: the\n\t\t\t\tnumber is known to Allah alone. The authority on which\n\t\t\t\tGibbon relies mentions two definite reigns, that of\n\t\t\t\tDecius (249-251 A.D.) and that of Theodosius 11 (408-450\n\t\t\t\tA.D.). Taking 250 and 450, we get an interval of 200\n\t\t\t\tyears. But the point of the story does not lie in the\n\t\t\t\tname of any given Emperor, but in the fact that the\n\t\t\t\tbeginning of the period coincided with an Emperor who\n\t\t\t\tpersecuted: the Emperor\u0027s name at the end of the period\n\t\t\t\tmay be taken as approximately correct, because the story\n\t\t\t\twas recorded within two generations afterwards. One of\n\t\t\t\tthe worst Emperors to persecute the Christians was Nero\n\t\t\t\twho reigned from 54 to 68. If we took the end of his\n\t\t\t\treign (A.D. 68) as the initial point, and (say) 440 A.D.\n\t\t\t\tas the final point, we get the 372 years of Simeon\n\t\t\t\tMetaphrastes. But none of these writers knew any more\n\t\t\t\tthan we do. Our best course is to follow the Quranic\n\t\t\t\tinjunction, \"Say, Allah knows best how long they stayed\"\n\t\t\t\t(xviii. 26). There is also a rebuke implied: \u0027do not\n\t\t\t\timitate these men who love mischievous controversies!\u0027\n\t\t\t\tAfter all, we are given the narrative more as a parable\n\t\t\t\tthan as a story."

(2) Constant effort is necessary to keep our\n\t\t\t\tknowledge square with the march of time, and such effort\n\t\t\t\tMoses is shown to be making. (3) The mysterious man he\n\t\t\t\tmeets (xviii. 65 and n. 2411), to whom Tradition assigns\n\t\t\t\tthe name of Khidhr (literally, Green), is the type of\n\t\t\t\tthat knowledge which is ever in contact with life as it\n\t\t\t\tis actually lived.

(1) The Samiri was no doubt\n\t\t\t\tresponsible for suggesting the making of the golden calf,\n\t\t\t\tbut they could not on that account disclaim\n\t\t\t\tresponsibility for themselves: the burden of the sin is\n\t\t\t\ton him who commits it, and he cannot pretend that he was\n\t\t\t\tpowerless to avoid it. (2) At most the weight of the gold\n\t\t\t\tthey carried could not have been heavy even if one or two\n\t\t\t\tmen carried it, but would have been negligible if\n\t\t\t\tdistributed. (3) Gold is valuable, and it is not likely\n\t\t\t\tthat if they wanted to disburden themselves of it, they\n\t\t\t\thad any need to light a furnace, melt it, and cast it\n\t\t\t\tinto the shape of a calf."

It may be interesting to pursue the\n\t\t\t\ttransformations of the word Samiri in later times. For\n\t\t\t\tits origin see notes 2605 and 2608 above. Whether the\n\t\t\t\troot of Samiri was originally Egyptian or Hebrew does not\n\t\t\t\taffect the later history. Four facts may be noted. (1)\n\t\t\t\tThere was a man bearing a name of that kind at the time\n\t\t\t\tof Moses, and he led a revolt against Moses and was\n\t\t\t\tcursed by Moses. (2) In the time of King Omri (903-896\n\t\t\t\tB.C.) of the northern kingdom of Israel, there was a man\n\t\t\t\tcalled Shemer, from whom, according to the Bible, was\n\t\t\t\tbought a hill on which was built the new capital of the\n\t\t\t\tkingdom, the town of Samaria. (3) The name of the hill\n\t\t\t\twas Shomer (= watchman, vigilant guardian), and that form\n\t\t\t\tof the name also appears as the name of a man (see II\n\t\t\t\tKings xii. 21); some authorities think the town was\n\t\t\t\tcalled after the hill and not after the man (Hastings\u0027s\n\t\t\t\tEncyclopaedia of Religion and Ethics), but this is for\n\t\t\t\tour present purposes immaterial. (4) There was and is a\n\t\t\t\tdissenting community of Israelites called Samaritans, who\n\t\t\t\thave their own separate Pentateuch and Targum, who claim\n\t\t\t\tto be the true Children of Israel, and who hold the\n\t\t\t\tOrthodox Jews in contempt as the latter hold them in\n\t\t\t\tcontempt; they claim to be the true guardians (Shomerim)\n\t\t\t\tof the Law, and that is probably the true origin of the\n\t\t\t\tname Samaritan, which may go further back in time than\n\t\t\t\tthe foundation of the town of Samaria. I think it\n\t\t\t\tprobable that the schism originated from the time of\n\t\t\t\tMoses, and that the curse of Moses on the Samiri explains\n\t\t\t\tthe position."

No one should be\n\t\t\t\timpatient about it. On the contrary, we should always\n\t\t\t\tpray for increase in our own knowledge, which can never\n\t\t\t\tat any given moment be complete."

Christ\u0027s saying in the present\n\t\t\t\tGospel of St. Matthew (iii. 7): \"O generation of vipers,\n\t\t\t\twho hath warned you to flee from the Wrath to come?\""

He was born in Ur of the Chaldees, a place on\n\t\t\t\tthe lower reaches of the Euphrates, not a hundred miles\n\t\t\t\tfrom the Persian Gulf. This was the cradle, or one of the\n\t\t\t\tcradles, of human civilisation. Astronomy was studied\n\t\t\t\there in very ancient times, and the worship of the sun,\n\t\t\t\tmoon, and stars was the prevailing form of religion.\n\t\t\t\tAbraham revolted against this quite early in life, and\n\t\t\t\this argument is referred to in vi. 74-82. They also had\n\t\t\t\tidols in their temples, probably idols representing\n\t\t\t\theavenly bodies and celestial winged creatures. He was\n\t\t\t\tstill a youth (xxi. 60) when he broke the idols. This was\n\t\t\t\tstage No. 2. After this he was marked down as a rebel and\n\t\t\t\tpersecuted. Perhaps some years passed before the incident\n\t\t\t\tof his being thrown into the Fire (xxi. 68-69) took\n\t\t\t\tplace. Traditionally the Fire incident is referred to a\n\t\t\t\tking called Nimrud, about whom see n. 1565 to xi. 69. If\n\t\t\t\tNimrud\u0027s capital was in Assyria, near Nineveh (site near\n\t\t\t\tmodern Mosul), we may suppose either that the king\u0027s rule\n\t\t\t\textended over the whole of Mesopotamia, or that Abraham\n\t\t\t\twandered north through Babylonia to Assyria. Various\n\t\t\t\tstratagems were devised to get rid of him (xxi. 70), but\n\t\t\t\the was saved by the mercy of Allah. The final break came\n\t\t\t\twhen he was probably a man of mature age and could speak\n\t\t\t\tto his father with some authority. This incident is\n\t\t\t\treferred to in xix. 41-48. He now left his ancestral\n\t\t\t\tlands, and avoiding the Syrian desert, came to the\n\t\t\t\tfertile lands of Aram or Syria, and so south to Canaan,\n\t\t\t\twhen the incident of xi. 69-76 took place. It is some\n\t\t\t\tyears after this that we may suppose he built the Ka\u0027ba\n\t\t\t\twith Isma\u0027il (ii, 124-29), and his prayer in xiv. 35-41\n\t\t\t\tmay be referred to the same time.

He\n\t\t\t\tsuffers from a number of calamities: his cattle are\n\t\t\t\tdestroyed, his servants slain by the sword, and his\n\t\t\t\tfamily crushed under his roof. But he holds fast to his\n\t\t\t\tfaith in Allah. As a further calamity he is covered with\n\t\t\t\tloathsome sores from head to foot. He loses his peace of\n\t\t\t\tmind, and he curses the day he was born. His false\n\t\t\t\tfriends come and attribute his afflictions to sin. These\n\t\t\t\t\"Job\u0027s comforters\" are no comforters at all, and he\n\t\t\t\tfurther loses his balance of mind, but Allah recalls to\n\t\t\t\thim all His mercies, and he resumes his humility and\n\t\t\t\tgives up self-justification. He is restored to\n\t\t\t\tprosperity, with twice as much as he had before; his\n\t\t\t\tbrethren and friends come back to him; he had a new\n\t\t\t\tfamily of seven sons and three fair daughters. He lived\n\t\t\t\tto a good old age, and saw four generations of\n\t\t\t\tdescendants. All this is recorded in the Book of Job in\n\t\t\t\tthe Old Testament. Of all the Hebrew writings, the Hebrew\n\t\t\t\tof this Book comes nearest to Arabic. The account given\n\t\t\t\tin the Biblical sources and the image that it projects of\n\t\t\t\tProphet Job is decidedly different from that found in the\n\t\t\t\tQur-an and the Hadith, which present him as a prophet and\n\t\t\t\tbrilliant example of dignified patience becoming of a\n\t\t\t\tgreat Prophet of Allah ever trustful in Him and His\n\t\t\t\tpromises.

I think the best suggestion is\n\t\t\t\tthat afforded by Karsten Niebuhr in his Reisebeschreibung\n\t\t\t\tnach Arabian, Copenhagen, 1778, ii. 264-266, as quoted in\n\t\t\t\tthe Encyclopaedia of Islam under \"Dhul-Kifl\". He visited\n\t\t\t\tMeshad \u0027All in \u0027Iraq, and also the little town called\n\t\t\t\tKefil, midway between Najaf and Hilla (Babylon). Kefil,\n\t\t\t\the says, is the Arabic form of Ezekiel. The shrine of\n\t\t\t\tEzekiel was there, and the Jews came to it on pilgrimage.\n\t\t\t\tIf we accept \"Zul-kifl\" to be not an epithet, but an\n\t\t\t\tArabicised form of \"Ezekiel\", it fits the context.\n\t\t\t\tEzekiel was a prophet in Israel who was carried away to\n\t\t\t\tBabylon by Nebuchadnezzar after his second attack on\n\t\t\t\tJerusalem (about B.C. 599). His Book is included in the\n\t\t\t\tEnglish Bible (Old Testament). He was chained and bound,\n\t\t\t\tand put into prison, and for a time he was dumb (Ezekiel,\n\t\t\t\tiii. 25-26). He bore all with patience and constancy, and\n\t\t\t\tcontinued to reprove boldly the evils in Israel. In a\n\t\t\t\tburning passage he denounces false leaders in words which\n\t\t\t\tare eternally true: \"Woe be to the shepherds of Israel\n\t\t\t\tthat do feed themselves! Should not the shepherds feed\n\t\t\t\tthe flocks? Ye eat the fat, and ye clothe you with the\n\t\t\t\twool, ye kill them that are fed: but ye feed not the\n\t\t\t\tflock. The diseased have ye not strengthened, neither\n\t\t\t\thave ye healed that which was sick, neither have ye bound\n\t\t\t\tup that which was broken ...... etc. (Ezekiel, xxxiv.\n\t\t\t\t2-4). Zul-kifl is again mentioned in xxxviii. 48 along\n\t\t\t\twith Isma\u0027il and Elisha."

When his first\n\t\t\t\twarning was unheeded by the people, he denounced Allah\u0027s\n\t\t\t\twrath on them. But they repented and Allah forgave them\n\t\t\t\tfor the time being.

He was swallowed by a big Fish\n\t\t\t\t(or Whale), but in the depth of the darkness, he cried to\n\t\t\t\tAllah and confessed his weakness. The \"darkness\" may be\n\t\t\t\tinterpreted both physically and spiritually; physically,\n\t\t\t\tas the darkness of the night and the storm and the Fish\u0027s\n\t\t\t\tbody; spiritually as the darkness in his soul, his\n\t\t\t\textreme distress in the situation which he had brought on\n\t\t\t\thimself.

For the various stages of creation,\n\t\t\t\tsee n. 120 to ii. 117. Here we are not concerned with the\n\t\t\t\tearliest stage, the creation of primeval matter out of\n\t\t\t\tnothing. It is also a process of creation when inorganic\n\t\t\t\tmatter becomes living matter. Thus inorganic constituents\n\t\t\t\tof the earth are absorbed into fiving matter by way of\n\t\t\t\tfood and living matter reproduces itself by means of\n\t\t\t\tsperm. This is deposited in the ovum and fertilises it\n\t\t\t\tand rests for a time in security in the mother\u0027s womb.\n\t\t\t\tThe first change in the fertilised ovum is the conversion\n\t\t\t\tinto a sort of clot of thickly congealed blood; the\n\t\t\t\tzygote cells grow by segmentation; then the mass\n\t\t\t\tgradually assumes shape in its growth as a foetus. From\n\t\t\t\tthe lump develop bones and flesh and organs and a nervous\n\t\t\t\tsystem. So far man\u0027s growth is like that of an animal,\n\t\t\t\tbut a further process takes place which makes the infant\n\t\t\t\tanimal into the infant man. This is the breathing from\n\t\t\t\tAllah\u0027s spirit into him (xv. 29). It may be a continuous\n\t\t\t\tprocess parallel to that of physical growth. The child is\n\t\t\t\tborn; it grows; it decays and dies; but after death\n\t\t\t\tanother chapter opens for the individual, and it is to\n\t\t\t\tremind us of this most momentous chapter that the\n\t\t\t\tprevious stages are recapitulated."

(3) Here is an admonition for the future: there\n\t\t\t\tmay be conspiracies and snares laid by evil against\n\t\t\t\tsimple people; it is Allah\u0027s grace that protects them.\n\t\t\t\t(4) In xxiv. 21, the general warning is directed to the\n\t\t\t\tobservance of purity in act and in thought, concerning\n\t\t\t\tone\u0027s self and concerning others: it is only Allah\u0027s\n\t\t\t\tgrace that can keep that purity spotless, for He hears\n\t\t\t\tprayers and knows of all the snares that are spread in\n\t\t\t\tthe path of the good."

Its height enabled it to diffuse the\n\t\t\t\tlight in the room and minimised the shadows. The\n\t\t\t\tbackground of the wall and the sides of the niche helped\n\t\t\t\tto throw the light well into the room, and if the wall\n\t\t\t\twas white-washed, it also acted as a reflector: the\n\t\t\t\topening in front made the way for the light.

As applied to the olive, there is also a more\n\t\t\t\tliteral meaning, which can be allegorised in a different\n\t\t\t\tway. An olive tree with an eastern aspect gets only the\n\t\t\t\trays of the morning sun; one with a western aspect, only\n\t\t\t\tthe rays of the western sun. In the northern hemisphere\n\t\t\t\tthe south aspect will give the sun\u0027s rays a great part of\n\t\t\t\tthe day, while a north aspect will shut them out\n\t\t\t\taltogether, and vice versa in the southern hemisphere.\n\t\t\t\tBut a tree in the open plain or on a hill will get\n\t\t\t\tperpetual sunshine by day; it will be more mature, and\n\t\t\t\tthe fruit and oil will be of superior quality. So Allah\u0027s\n\t\t\t\tlight is not localised or immature: it is perfect and\n\t\t\t\tuniversal."

They are free to mingle, and in a\n\t\t\t\tsense they do mingle, for there is a regular water-cycle:\n\t\t\t\tsee n. 3106 above: and the rivers flow constantly to the\n\t\t\t\tsea, and tidal rivers get sea-water for several miles up\n\t\t\t\ttheir estuaries at high tide.

In the case of rivers\n\t\t\t\tcarrying large quantities of water to the sea, like the\n\t\t\t\tMississippi or the Yangtse-Kiang, the river-water with\n\t\t\t\tits silt remains distinct from sea-water for a long\n\t\t\t\tdistance out at sea.

(2) In body he was with Israel in the\n\t\t\t\twilderness, but his heart was in Egypt with its fertility\n\t\t\t\tand its slavery. Such is the case of many hypocrites, who\n\t\t\t\tlike to be seen in righteous company but whose thoughts,\n\t\t\t\tlongings, and doing are inconsistent with such company.\n\t\t\t\t(3) There is no good in this life but comes from Allah.\n\t\t\t\tTo think otherwise is to set up a false god besides\n\t\t\t\tAllah, Our own merits are so small that they should never\n\t\t\t\tbe the object of our idolatry.

Then there is what is ordinarily\n\t\t\t\tcalled a spider\u0027s web, consisting of a central point with\n\t\t\t\tradiating threads running in all directions and acting as\n\t\t\t\ttie-beams to the quasi-circular concentric threads that\n\t\t\t\tform the body of the web. This is his hunting box. The\n\t\t\t\twhole structure exemplifies economy in time, material,\n\t\t\t\tand strength. If an insect is caught in the net, the\n\t\t\t\tvibration set up in the radiating threads is at once\n\t\t\t\tcommunicated to the spider, who can come and kill his\n\t\t\t\tprey. In case the prey is powerful, the spider is\n\t\t\t\tfurnished with poison glands with which to kill his prey.\n\t\t\t\tThe spider sits either in the centre of the web or hides\n\t\t\t\ton the under-side of a leaf or in some crevice, but he\n\t\t\t\talways has a single thread connecting him with his web,\n\t\t\t\tto keep him in telephonic communication. The female\n\t\t\t\tspider is much bigger than the male, and in Arabic the\n\t\t\t\tgeneric gender of \u0027Ankabut is feminine."

For the names of\n\t\t\t\tsome Jews who recognized and embraced Islam, see n. 3227\n\t\t\t\tto xxvi. 197. Among the Christians, too, the Faith slowly\n\t\t\t\twon ground. Embassies were sent by the holy Prophet in\n\t\t\t\tthe 6th and 7th years of the Hijrat to all the principal\n\t\t\t\tcountries round Arabia, viz., the capital of the\n\t\t\t\tByzantine Empire (Constantinople), the capital of the\n\t\t\t\tPersian Empire (Madain), the Sasanian capital known to\n\t\t\t\tthe West by the Greek name of Ctesiphon, (about thirty\n\t\t\t\tmiles south of modern Bagdad), Syria, Abyssinia, and\n\t\t\t\tEgypt. All these (except Persia) were Christian\n\t\t\t\tcountries. In the same connection an embassy was also\n\t\t\t\tsent to Yamama in Arabia itself (east of the Hijaz) where\n\t\t\t\tthe Banu Hanifa tribe was Christian, like the Harith\n\t\t\t\ttribe of Najran who voluntarily sent an embassy to\n\t\t\t\tMadinah. All these countries except Abyssinia eventually\n\t\t\t\tbecame Muslim, and Abyssinia itself has a considerable\n\t\t\t\tMuslim population now and sent some Muslim converts to\n\t\t\t\tMadinah in the time of the Prophet himself. As a\n\t\t\t\tgeneralization it is true that the Jewish and the\n\t\t\t\tChristian peoples as they existed in the seventh century\n\t\t\t\tof the Christian era have been mainly absorbed by Islam,\n\t\t\t\tas well as the lands in which they predominated. Remnants\n\t\t\t\tof them built up new nuclei. The Roman Catholic Church\n\t\t\t\tconquered new lands among the northern (Germanic) Pagans\n\t\t\t\tand the Byzantine Church among the eastern (Slavonic)\n\t\t\t\tPagans, and the Protestantism of the 16th century gave a\n\t\t\t\tfresh stimulus to the main ideas for which Islam stands,\n\t\t\t\tviz., the abolition of priest craft, the right of private\n\t\t\t\tjudgment, the simplification of ritual, and the\n\t\t\t\tinsistence upon the simple, practical, everyday duties of\n\t\t\t\tlife."

(4) Next we turn to our\n\t\t\t\tpsychological conditions, sleep, rest, visions, insight,\n\t\t\t\tetc.; here we want teaching and guidance, to which we\n\t\t\t\tmust hearken (xxx. 23). (5) Next, we must approach the\n\t\t\t\thigher reaches of spiritual hopes and fears, as\n\t\t\t\tsymbolized by such subtle forces of nature as lightning\n\t\t\t\tand electricity, which may kill the foolish or bring\n\t\t\t\tprosperity in its train by rain and abundant harvest; to\n\t\t\t\tunderstand the highest spiritual hopes and fears so\n\t\t\t\tsymbolized, we want the highest wisdom (xxx. 24).

Their bond of union was the\n\t\t\t\tcommon hatred of Islam, and it snapped under the reverses\n\t\t\t\tthey met with. It is important to note three points. (1)\n\t\t\t\tThe Jews as a body now lost their last chance of bearing\n\t\t\t\tthe standard of Islam: the best of them had already\n\t\t\t\taccepted the renewal of Allah\u0027s Message.

(4) They forgot all the promises of fidelity\n\t\t\t\twhich they had previously sworn (verse 15). (5) In their\n\t\t\t\tpaltry calculations they forgot that cowardice in war\n\t\t\t\tdoes not pay (verses 16-17).

Its inhabitants offered some\n\t\t\t\tresistance, and Hadhrat \u0027Ali, though he had just risen\n\t\t\t\tfrom a bed of illness, performed prodigies of valour.\n\t\t\t\tAfter its surrender, a land settlement was made, which\n\t\t\t\tretained the cultivators of the soil on the land, but\n\t\t\t\tbrought them under control, so that no further focus of\n\t\t\t\tactive hostility should remain near Madinah. The terms of\n\t\t\t\tthe settlement will be found in Waqidi."

        "Body":  "We now come to the subject of the position of the\n\t\t\t\tConsorts of Purity (azwaj mutahharat), the wives of the\n\t\t\t\tholy Prophet. Their position was not like that of\n\t\t\t\tordinary women or ordinary wives. They had special duties\n\t\t\t\tand responsibilities. The only youthful marriage of the\n\t\t\t\tholy Prophet was his first marriage-that with Hadhrat\n\t\t\t\tKhadija, the best of women and the best of wives. He\n\t\t\t\tmarried her fifteen years before he received his call to\n\t\t\t\tProphethood; their married life lasted for twenty-five\n\t\t\t\tyears, and their mutual devotion was of the noblest,\n\t\t\t\tjudged by spiritual as well as social standards. During\n\t\t\t\ther life he had no other wife, which was unusual for a\n\t\t\t\tman of his standing among his people. When she died, his\n\t\t\t\tage was 50, and but for two considerations, he would\n\t\t\t\tprobably never have married again, as he was most\n\t\t\t\tabstemious in his physical life. The two considerations\n\t\t\t\twhich governed his later marriages were: (1) compassion\n\t\t\t\tand clemency, as when he wanted to provide for suffering\n\t\t\t\twidows, who could not be provided for in any other way in\n\t\t\t\tthat stage of society; some of them, like Sauda, had\n\t\t\t\tissue by their former marriage, requiring protection; (2)\n\t\t\t\thelp in his duties of leadership, with women, who had to\n\t\t\t\tbe instructed and kept together in the large Muslim\n\t\t\t\tfamily, where women and men had similar social rights.\n\t\t\t\tHadhrat Aisha, daughter of Hadhrat Abu Bakr, was clever\n\t\t\t\tand learned, and in Hadith she is an important authority\n\t\t\t\ton the life of the Prophet. Hadhrat Zainab, daughter of\n\t\t\t\tKhuzaima, was specially devoted to the poor; she was\n\t\t\t\tcalled the \"Mother of the Poor\". The other Zainab,\n\t\t\t\tdaughter of Jahsh, also worked for the poor, for whom she\n\t\t\t\tprovided from the proceeds of her manual work, as she was\n\t\t\t\tskillful in leather work. But all the Consorts in their\n\t\t\t\thigh position had to work and assist as Mothers of the\n\t\t\t\tUmmat. Theirs were not idle lives, like those of\n\t\t\t\tOdalisques, either for their own pleasure or the pleasure\n\t\t\t\tof their husband. They are told here that they had no\n\t\t\t\tplace in the sacred Household if they merely wished for\n\t\t\t\tease or worldly glitter. If such were the case, they\n\t\t\t\tcould be divorced and amply provided for."

(2) Have your gods created or\n\t\t\t\toriginated anything on earth? You may worship power or\n\t\t\t\twealth, but that is a scramble for things as between\n\t\t\t\tselfish men. Power or wealth does not create new men or\n\t\t\t\tnew worlds. (3) Have they a share in the ordering of the\n\t\t\t\theavens? Obviously your false gods fail there.

In the story told here\n\t\t\t\t\"by way of a parable\", the City rejected the Message, and\n\t\t\t\tthe City was destroyed: xxxvi. 29. Following Ibn Kathir,\n\t\t\t\tI reject the identification with Antioch decisively. No\n\t\t\t\tname, or period, or place is mentioned in the text. The\n\t\t\t\tsignificance of the story is in the lessons to be derived\n\t\t\t\tfrom it as a parable, for which see the next note. That\n\t\t\t\tis independent of name, time, or place."

In vii. 137 we have Mashariq\n\t\t\t\tal ardhi wa magaribaha, where the plural of the words for\n\t\t\t\tEast and West is negligible, as the conjunction of the\n\t\t\t\ttwo embraces all points.

In lv. 17 Allah is called \"Lord of\n\t\t\t\tthe two Easts and the two Wests\", referring to the\n\t\t\t\textreme points in either case. A cursory reader may ask,\n\t\t\t\twhy is only the East referred to here? The reply is that\n\t\t\t\tit is not so much the East as the rising of the sun, on\n\t\t\t\twhich stress is laid. The Arabic mashriq or mashariq is\n\t\t\t\tclose enough to the root-word sharaqa, to suggest, not so\n\t\t\t\tmuch the East as the rising of the sun, especially when\n\t\t\t\tthe plural form is used. The glorious sun rises from\n\t\t\t\tdifferent points, as seen by us, but it illuminates the\n\t\t\t\twhole heaven and earth. It is an emblem of Unity."

Now Isaac was born when Abraham was\n\t\t\t\t100 years old (Gen. xxi. 5), while Isma\u0027il was born to\n\t\t\t\tAbraham when Abraham was 86 years old (Gen. xvi. 16).\n\t\t\t\tIsma\u0027il was therefore 14 years older than Isaac.

Yet, in\n\t\t\t\tspeaking of the sacrifice, the Old Testament says (Gen.\n\t\t\t\txxii. 2): \"And He said, Take now thy son, thine only son\n\t\t\t\tIssac, whom thou lovest, and get thee into the land of\n\t\t\t\tMoriah: and offer him there for a burnt offering...\" This\n\t\t\t\tslip shows at any rate which was the older version, and\n\t\t\t\thow it was overlaid, like the present Jewish records, in\n\t\t\t\tthe interests of a tribal religion.

As far as animal life is\n\t\t\t\tconcerned, it is the cessation of the working of the\n\t\t\t\tnervous system, though other animal functions, such as\n\t\t\t\tdigestion, growth, and the circulation of the blood,\n\t\t\t\tcontinue, possibly at a different pace. It is the repose\n\t\t\t\tof the nervous system, and in this respect it is common\n\t\t\t\tto man and animals, and perhaps even to plants, if, as is\n\t\t\t\tprobable, plants have a nervous system. The mental\n\t\t\t\tprocesses (and certainly volition) are also suspended in\n\t\t\t\tsleep, except that in ordinary dreams there is a medley\n\t\t\t\tof recollections, which often present vividly to our\n\t\t\t\tconsciousness things that do not or cannot happen in\n\t\t\t\tnature as we know it in our coordinated minds. But there\n\t\t\t\tis another kind of dream which is rarer-one in which the\n\t\t\t\tdreamer sees things as they actually happen, backwards or\n\t\t\t\tforwards in time, or in which gifted individuals see\n\t\t\t\tspiritual truths otherwise imperceptible to them. How can\n\t\t\t\twe explain this? It is suggested that our soul or\n\t\t\t\tpersonality,-that something which is above our animal\n\t\t\t\tlife-is then in a plane of spiritual existence akin to\n\t\t\t\tphysical death (see last note), when we are nearer to\n\t\t\t\tAllah.

In the Biblical cosmogony,\n\t\t\t\t(Gen. i, and ii. 1-7), which reflects old Babylonian\n\t\t\t\tcosmogony, the scheme is apparently to be taken literally\n\t\t\t\tas to days and is as follows. The first day Allah created\n\t\t\t\tlight; the second, the firmament; the third, the earth\n\t\t\t\tand vegetation; the fourth, the stars and plants; the\n\t\t\t\tfifth, fish and fowl from the sea; and the sixth, cattle,\n\t\t\t\tcreeping things, beasts on land, and man; on the seventh\n\t\t\t\tday He ended His work and rested. Our scheme is wholly\n\t\t\t\tdifferent. (1) Allah did not rest, and never rests. \"His\n\t\t\t\tThrone doth extend over the heavens and the earth, and He\n\t\t\t\tfeeleth no fatigue in guarding and preserving them\"; (2)\n\t\t\t\tAllah\u0027s work has not ended; His activity still goes on:\n\t\t\t\txxxii. 5; vii, 54; (3) man in our scheme does not come in\n\t\t\t\twith land animals; his advent is much later; (4) our\n\t\t\t\tstages are not sharply divided from each other, as in the\n\t\t\t\tabove scheme, where the stars and planets having been\n\t\t\t\tcreated on the fourth day, it is not intelligible how the\n\t\t\t\tfirst three days were counted, nor how vegetation grew on\n\t\t\t\tthe third day. Our stages for earth and heaven are not in\n\t\t\t\tsequence of time for the heavens and the earth. Our six\n\t\t\t\tstages are broadly speaking, (1) the throwing off of our\n\t\t\t\tplanet from cosmic matter; (2) its cooling and\n\t\t\t\tcondensing; (3) and (4) the growth of vegetable and\n\t\t\t\tanimal life; (5) and (6) the parallel growth of the\n\t\t\t\tstarry realm and our solar system."

When you stand up for rights, either on\n\t\t\t\tprivate or public grounds, it may be through processes of\n\t\t\t\tlaw, or by way of private defence in so far as the law\n\t\t\t\tpermits private action. But in all cases you must not\n\t\t\t\tseek a compensation greater than the injury suffered. The\n\t\t\t\tmost you can do is to demand equal redress, i.e., a harm\n\t\t\t\tequivalent to the harm done to you. Even this may serve\n\t\t\t\tto curb your unregenerate soul, or a community bent on\n\t\t\t\trevenge. But the ideal mode is not to slake your thirst\n\t\t\t\tfor vengeance, but to follow better ways leading to the\n\t\t\t\treform of the offender or his reconciliation. See xli.\n\t\t\t\t34, and xxiii. 96. You can take steps to prevent\n\t\t\t\trepetition, by physical or moral means; the best moral\n\t\t\t\tmeans would be to turn hatred into friendship by\n\t\t\t\tforgiveness and love. In that case the compensation or\n\t\t\t\treward (if we must use such terms) is infinitely greater,\n\t\t\t\tfor it wins the good pleasure of Allah. But this active\n\t\t\t\trighting of wrongs, whether by physical or by moral or\n\t\t\t\tspiritual means, which are commended as better, is an\n\t\t\t\tantithesis to the monkish doctrine, when you are smitten\n\t\t\t\ton one cheek, to turn the other also. This would not\n\t\t\t\tsuppress, but encourage wrong-doing. It is practised by\n\t\t\t\tnone but poltroons, and is preached only by hypocrites,\n\t\t\t\tor men who want to make slaves of others by depriving\n\t\t\t\tthem of the power of self-defence. It occurs in two of\n\t\t\t\tthe four canonical Gospels (Matt. v. 39, and Luke vi.\n\t\t\t\t29), but we need not therefore assume that it was\n\t\t\t\tpreached by Jesus."

Ibn Kathir in his Tarikh\n\t\t\t\tmentions two famines in Makkah, one in the 8th year of\n\t\t\t\tthe Mission, say the fourth year before the Hijra, and\n\t\t\t\tanother about the 8th year after the Hijra. But as either\n\t\t\t\tor both of these famines lasted as many as seven years,\n\t\t\t\tthe dates are to be taken very roughly. It is even\n\t\t\t\tpossible that the two famines were continuous, of varying\n\t\t\t\tseverity from year to year. Bukhari mentions only the\n\t\t\t\tpost-Hijrat famine, which was apparently so severe that\n\t\t\t\tmen began to eat bones and carrion. Abu Sufyan (about 8\n\t\t\t\tA.H.) approached the holy Prophet to intercede and pray\n\t\t\t\tfor the removal of the famine, as the Pagans attributed\n\t\t\t\tit to the curse of the Prophet. Sura xxiii., which is\n\t\t\t\talso Makkan, but of later date than the present Sura,\n\t\t\t\talso refers to a famine: see xxiii. 75, and n. 2921. As\n\t\t\t\tSuras were not all revealed entire, but many came\n\t\t\t\tpiecemeal, it is possible that particular verses in a\n\t\t\t\tgiven Sura may be of different dates from the Sura as a\n\t\t\t\twhole."

The lower milk\n\t\t\t\tincisors in the centre come out between the 6th and 9th\n\t\t\t\tmonths; then come out the milk teeth at intervals, until\n\t\t\t\tthe canines appear. The second molars come out at about\n\t\t\t\t24 months, and with them the child has a complete\n\t\t\t\tapparatus of milk teeth. Nature now expects him to chew\n\t\t\t\tand masticate and be independent of his mother\u0027s milk\n\t\t\t\tcompletely. On the other hand it hurts the mother to feed\n\t\t\t\tfrom the breast after the child has a complete set of\n\t\t\t\tmilk teeth.

The five Signs to which appeal is made\n\t\t\t\tare: (1) the Mount (of Revelation), verse 1; (2) the Book\n\t\t\t\tInscribed, verses 2-3; (3) The Much-frequented House,\n\t\t\t\tverse 4; (4) the Canopy Raised High, verse 5; and (5) the\n\t\t\t\tOcean filled with Swell, verse 6. Let us examine these in\n\t\t\t\tdetail. Each of them has a figurative meaning. (1) The\n\t\t\t\tMount is the sublime world of Revelation. In the case of\n\t\t\t\tMoses it is typified by Mount Sinai: Cf. xcv. 2, where it\n\t\t\t\tis mentioned in juxtaposition to the sacred territory of\n\t\t\t\tMakkah, xcv. 3. In the case of Jesus it is the Mount of\n\t\t\t\tOlives: Cf. xcv. 1, and also Matt. xxiv. 3-51, where\n\t\t\t\tJesus made his striking pronouncement about the Judgment\n\t\t\t\tto come. In the case of Muhammad it is the Mountain of\n\t\t\t\tLight, where he first received the revelation: Cf. n. 11\n\t\t\t\t(2). The Book Inscribed is Allah\u0027s Eternal word. When it\n\t\t\t\tbecomes Revelation to man, it is figured forth as\n\t\t\t\tsomething \"inscribed\", reduced to writing; and as it is\n\t\t\t\tmade clear to the intelligence of man, it is further\n\t\t\t\tdescribed as \"in a parchment unfolded\", that is, spread\n\t\t\t\tout so that everyone who has the will can seek its\n\t\t\t\tguidance."

The whole Sura is a\n\t\t\t\tsymphony of Duality, which leads up to Unity, as\n\t\t\t\texplained in the Introduction. All creation is in pairs:\n\t\t\t\tli. 49, and notes 5025-26; xxxvi. 36, n. 3981. Justice is\n\t\t\t\tthe conciliation of two opposites to unity, the\n\t\t\t\tsettlement of the unending feud between Right and Wrong.\n\t\t\t\tThe things and concepts mentioned in this Sura are in\n\t\t\t\tpairs: man and outer nature; sun and moon; herbs and\n\t\t\t\ttrees; heaven and earth; fruit and corn; human food and\n\t\t\t\tfodder for cattle; things nourishing and things\n\t\t\t\tsweet-smelling; and so on throughout the Sura. Then there\n\t\t\t\tis man and Jinn, for which see n. 5182 below. \"Will ye\n\t\t\t\tdeny?\" that is, fail to acknowledge either in word or\n\t\t\t\tthought or in your conduct. If you misuse Allah\u0027s gifts\n\t\t\t\tor ignore them, that is equivalent to ingratitude or\n\t\t\t\tdenial or refusal to profit by Allah\u0027s infinite Grace."

The Qur-an is the final revelation in which He\n\t\t\t\tsaid: \"ye are the best Ummah brought forward to mankind.\"\n\t\t\t\tSo in order to receive His Grace, one should submit to\n\t\t\t\tIslam."

Similar points\n\t\t\t\tapply to men, but here the question is about women, and\n\t\t\t\tespecially such as were likely, in those early days of\n\t\t\t\tIslam, to come from Pagan society into Muslim society in\n\t\t\t\tthe conditions discussed in notes 5422 and 5423 above. A\n\t\t\t\tpledge on these points would search out their real\n\t\t\t\tmotives: (1) to worship none but Allah; (2) not to steal;\n\t\t\t\t(3) not to indulge in sex outside the marriage tie; (4)\n\t\t\t\tnot to commit infanticide; (the Pagan Arabs were prone to\n\t\t\t\tfemale infanticide): (5) not to indulge in slander or\n\t\t\t\tscandal; and (6) generally, to obey loyally the law and\n\t\t\t\tprinciples of Islam. The last was a comprehensive and\n\t\t\t\tsufficient phrase, but it was good to indicate also the\n\t\t\t\tspecial points to which attention was to be directed in\n\t\t\t\tthose special circumstances. Obedience was of course to\n\t\t\t\tbe in all things just and reasonable: Islam requires\n\t\t\t\tstrict discipline but not slavishness. A) \"That they will\n\t\t\t\tnot utter slander intentionally forging falsehood\".\n\t\t\t\tLiterally, \"...nor produce any lie that they have devised\n\t\t\t\tbetween their hands and feet,\".

The Jewish Sabbath is primarily\n\t\t\t\ta commemoration of Allah\u0027s ending His work and resting on\n\t\t\t\tthe seventh day (Gen. ii. 2; Exod. xx. 11): we are taught\n\t\t\t\tthat Allah needs no rest, nor does He feel fatigue (ii.\n\t\t\t\t255). The Jewish command forbids work on that day but\n\t\t\t\tsays nothing about worship or prayer (Exod. xx. 10); our\n\t\t\t\tordinance lays chief stress on the remembrance of Allah.\n\t\t\t\tJewish formalism went so far as to kill the spirit of the\n\t\t\t\tsabbath, and call forth the protest of Jesus: \"the\n\t\t\t\tsabbath was made for man, and not man for the sabbath\"\n\t\t\t\t(Mark. ii. 27). But the Christian Church, although it has\n\t\t\t\tchanged the day from Saturday to Sunday, has inherited\n\t\t\t\tthe Jewish spirit: witness the Scottish Sabbath; except\n\t\t\t\tin so far as it has been secularised. Our teaching says:\n\t\t\t\t\u0027When the time for Jumua Prayer comes, close your\n\t\t\t\tbusiness and answer the summons loyally and earnestly,\n\t\t\t\tmeet earnestly, pray, consult and learn by social\n\t\t\t\tcontact; when the meeting is over, scatter and go about\n\t\t\t\tyour business\u0027."

The commentators usually cite the\n\t\t\t\tfollowing incident in connection with the revelation of\n\t\t\t\tthese verses. It is narrated from \u0027Aisha, the wife of the\n\t\t\t\tholy Prophet (peace be on him) by Bukhari, Muslim, Nasai.\n\t\t\t\tAbu Dawud and others that the holy Prophet usually\n\t\t\t\tvisited all his wives daily after \u0027Asr Prayer.

So when his wives hinted at it, he vowed that he\n\t\t\t\twould never again use honey. Thereupon these verses were\n\t\t\t\trevealed reminding him that he should not declare to\n\t\t\t\thimself unlawful that which Allah had made lawful to him.\n\t\t\t\tThe important point to bear in mind is that he was at\n\t\t\t\tonce rectified by revelation, which reinforces the fact\n\t\t\t\tthat the prophets are always under divine protection, and\n\t\t\t\teven the slightest lapse on their part is never left\n\t\t\t\tuncorrected."

(2) But Conscience and the sense of Right\n\t\t\t\twill try to prevent the flight; the Grace of Allah will\n\t\t\t\tmeet the sinner at all corners and try to reclaim him;\n\t\t\t\tthe hardened sinner will deliberately turn away his face\n\t\t\t\tfrom it, insult it, and reject it. (3) The result of this\n\t\t\t\tpsychology will be that he will abandon himself to greed,\n\t\t\t\tto the correction of riches, and the acquisition of\n\t\t\t\tmaterial advantages to which he is not entitied; this may\n\t\t\t\tinvolve hypocrisy, fraud, and crime. (4) Having acquired\n\t\t\t\tthe material advantages, the next step will be to keep\n\t\t\t\tothers out of them, to prevent hoarded wealth from\n\t\t\t\tfructifying by circulation, to conceal it from envy or\n\t\t\t\tspite.

How can\n\t\t\t\tits precious and subtle worth and the spiritual\n\t\t\t\tsafeguards against its misuse by human folly or the\n\t\t\t\tperversity of evil be expressed in plain human words? We\n\t\t\t\tcan imagine a very great treasure, which has to be\n\t\t\t\ttransmitted. To guard it against evilly-disposed persons,\n\t\t\t\ta strong escort is required, to march in front and\n\t\t\t\tbehind, so as to protect it from all sides. When it\n\t\t\t\treaches its destination, the escort presents its\n\t\t\t\tcredentials and an Invoice showing the Treasure being\n\t\t\t\ttransmitted. Then the destined receiver knows that it has\n\t\t\t\tcome intact and feels satisfied. So about spiritual\n\t\t\t\tRevelation. The Prophet recognises the credentials and\n\t\t\t\tchecks the contents on the tablets of his own heart and\n\t\t\t\tinsight. He has then no doubt that it is a true Message\n\t\t\t\tfrom Allah, and that those who bring it are the true\n\t\t\t\tmessengers \"of their Lord\". A) They: the band of\n\t\t\t\twatchers. In \"he may know\" it is better to construe \"he\"\n\t\t\t\tto refer to the prophet who receives the Message from the\n\t\t\t\t\"watchers\"."

There was a great volume of\n\t\t\t\tangelology in the religious literature of the People of\n\t\t\t\tthe Book (i.e., the Jews and Christians) to whom (among\n\t\t\t\tothers) an appeal is made in this verse. The Essenes, a\n\t\t\t\tJewish brotherhood with highly spiritual ideas; to which\n\t\t\t\tperhaps the prophet Jesus himself belonged, had an\n\t\t\t\textensive literature of angelology. In the Midrash also,\n\t\t\t\twhich was a Jewish school of exegesis and mystical\n\t\t\t\tinterpretation, there was much said about angels. The\n\t\t\t\tEastern Christian sects contemporary with the birth of\n\t\t\t\tIslam had borrowed and developed many of these ideas, and\n\t\t\t\ttheir mystics owed much to the Gnostics and the Persian\n\t\t\t\tapocalyptic systems. In the New Testament the relation of\n\t\t\t\tthe angels with Fire is referred to more than once. In\n\t\t\t\tRev. ix. 11 we have \"the angel of the bottomless pit,\n\t\t\t\twhose naine in the Hebrew tongue is Abaddon, but in the\n\t\t\t\tGreek tongue hath his name Apollyon\". In Rev. xiv. 18\n\t\t\t\tthere is an \"angel which had power over fire\", and in\n\t\t\t\tRev. xvi. 8 an angel has \"power ... given unto him to\n\t\t\t\tscorch men with fire\". In the Old Testament (Daniel vii.\n\t\t\t\t9-10) the essence of all angels is fire: thousand\n\t\t\t\tthousands of them issued as a fiery stream from before\n\t\t\t\tthe Ancient of Days, whose \"throne was like the fiery\n\t\t\t\tflame, and His wheels as burning fire\"."

As to (1), \"morning and evening\"\n\t\t\t\tmeans all the waking hours of our life, but in the\n\t\t\t\tspecial hours of morning and evening the physical world\n\t\t\t\twithout us, and the inner world within us, combine to\n\t\t\t\tmake us specially receptive of spiritual influences.

(1) They come\n\t\t\t\tsoftly, on beneficent errands of Mercy; (2) they are\n\t\t\t\tcharged with the mission of punishment and destruction\n\t\t\t\tfor sin as in the case of the two angels who came to Lut\n\t\t\t\t(xv. 57-66); (3) they distribute Allah\u0027s Mercies as the\n\t\t\t\tWinds distribute good seeds; (4) they sort out the good\n\t\t\t\tfrom the evil among men; and (5) they are the agency\n\t\t\t\tthrough which Allah\u0027s Messages and Revelations are\n\t\t\t\tconveyed to the Prophets (see No. 5 in the last note)."

(1) The Prophets\n\t\t\t\thave followed one another in a series: the verses of the\n\t\t\t\tQur-an came, one after another as needed; in both cases\n\t\t\t\tit was for man\u0027s spiritual profit; (2) they caused great\n\t\t\t\tdisturbance in a spiritual decadent world; they pulled\n\t\t\t\tdown evil institutions root and branch, and substituted\n\t\t\t\tnew ones; (3) they proclaimed their truths far and wide,\n\t\t\t\twithout fear and without favour; (4) through them were\n\t\t\t\tsorted out men of Faith and rebels against Allah\u0027s Law;\n\t\t\t\tand (5) they gave a Message, through which just men were\n\t\t\t\tjustified through repentance, and evil men were warned of\n\t\t\t\ttheir sins. Some Commentators take one or other of these\n\t\t\t\tallegories, and some apply one allegory to a few of these\n\t\t\t\tverses, and another to another few. In my opinion the\n\t\t\t\tAllegory is wide enough to comprehend all the meanings\n\t\t\t\twhich I have sketched.

He has to contend, again\n\t\t\t\tand again, with verities of a realm beyond man\u0027s normal\n\t\t\t\trange of experience expressed in elliptical language and\n\t\t\t\the has to render them in another language with words of\n\t\t\t\tprecision intelligible to readers. It is therefore\n\t\t\t\tnecessary for him to put in part of the Commentary in the\n\t\t\t\tTranslation in such cases. The evidence of five things is\n\t\t\t\there invoked in verses 1-5, in order to lead to the\n\t\t\t\tconclusion in verse 6 and those following.

The words are perfectly general,\n\t\t\t\tand we need not search for particular names, except by\n\t\t\t\tway of illustration. In ancient history, and in Medieval\n\t\t\t\tEurope, many lives were sacrificed at the stake because\n\t\t\t\tthe victims did not conform to the established religion.\n\t\t\t\tIn Arab tradition there is the story of Abraham: Nimrud\n\t\t\t\ttries to burn him to death, but on account of Abraham\u0027s\n\t\t\t\tFaith, the fire became \"a means of safety for Abraham\":\n\t\t\t\txxi. 69, and n. 2725. Another case cited is that of\n\t\t\t\tZu-Nuwas, the last Himyarite King of Yemen, by religion a\n\t\t\t\tJew, who persecuted the Christians of Najran and is said\n\t\t\t\tto have burnt them to death.

While the words are perfectly general, a\n\t\t\t\treference is suggested to the persecution to which the\n\t\t\t\tearly Muslims were subjected by the Pagan Quraish. Among\n\t\t\t\tother cruelties, they were stripped, and their skins were\n\t\t\t\texposed to the burning rays of the Arabian summer sun."

Off they go, striking\n\t\t\t\tfire with their hoofs by night at the behest of their\n\t\t\t\triders; they push home the charge in the moming,\n\t\t\t\tchivalrously giving the enemy the benefit of daylight;\n\t\t\t\tand regardless of flashing steel or the weapons of their\n\t\t\t\tenemies they boldly penetrate into the midst of their\n\t\t\t\tfoe, risking their lives for the Cause.
